When an observation or battery requires multiple specimens for their performance (e.g., creatinine clearance requires a 24-hour urine specimen and a serum specimen), multiple segments may be included, one for each specimen type.\r\n\r\nOM4 is a repeating segment.  It allows multiple specimens per Order Code and accommodates for multiple alternate specimen for each preferred specimen.  In some cases an Order Code can require multiple specimens.  In many cases there are preferred specimens and for each preferred it is possible to have one or more alternative specimens.
