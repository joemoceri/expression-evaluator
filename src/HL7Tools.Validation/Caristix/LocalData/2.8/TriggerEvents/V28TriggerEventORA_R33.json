Refer to HL7 Table 0211 - Alternate Character Sets for valid values.\r\n\r\nAn HL7 message uses field MSH-18 Character Set to specify the character set(s) in use. Valid values for this field are specified in HL7 Table 0211 - Alternate Character Sets. MSH-18 Character Set may be left blank, or may contain one or more values delimited by the repetition separator. If the field is left blank, the character set in use is understood to be the 7-bit ASCII set, decimal 0 through decimal 127 (hex 00 through hex 7F). This default value may also be explicitly specified as ASCII.\r\n\r\nMore than one character set may be used in a message. The first occurrence, if supplied, of the MSH-18 must indicate the default encoding of the message. The second and subsequent occurrences of MSH-18-character set are used to specify additional character sets that are used.\r\nThe repetitions of this field to specify different character sets apply only to fields of the FT, ST and TX data types. See also section 2.7.2, \"Escape sequences supporting multiple character sets\".\r\n\r\nAny encoding system, single-byte or multi-byte, may be specified as the default character encoding in MSH-18 Character Set. If the default encoding is other than 7-bit ASCII, sites shall document this usage in the dynamic conformance profile or other implementation agreement. This is particularly effective in promoting interoperability between nations belonging to different HL7 Affiliates, while limiting the amount of testing required to determine the encoding of a message.\r\n\r\nBy using built-in language functions for string and character manipulation, parsers and applications need not be concerned whether a single or double byte character set is in use, provided it is applied to the entire message. Using a built in function to extract the fourth CHARACTER will always yield the field separator character, regardless of coding set. On the other hand, if the parser looks at the fourth BYTE, it is then limited to single byte character sets, since the fourth byte would contain the low order 8 bits of the character S in a double-byte system.\r\n\r\nNote: When describing encoding rules, this standard always speaks in terms of character position, not byte offset. Similarly, comparisons should be done on character values, not their byte equivalents. For this reason, delimiter characters should always have representation in the standard 7-bit ASCII character set, regardless of the actual character set being used, so that a search for the character CR (carriage return) can be performed.\r\n   a) if the field is not valued, the default single-byte character set (ASCII (\"ISO IR6\")) should be assumed. No other character sets are allowed in the message.\r\n   b) if the field repeats, but the first element is NULL (i.e., present but unvalued), the single-byte ASCII (\"ISO IR6\") is assumed as the default character set.\r\n   c) elements in the remainder of the sequence (i.e., elements 2..n) are alternate character sets that may be used.","sample":"","fields":[]},{"id":"MSH.19","type":"Field","position":"MSH.19","name":"Principal Language Of Message","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":"This field contains the principal language of the message.

To accomplish this, an acknowledgement message with 2 ERR segments is sent. Upon receipt, the sending application can display both, including the appropriate severity, to the user.\r\n\r\nApplication Error Code: A receiving application generates an error that reports an application error code and returns this information in its response. This code in turn is used by helpdesk staff to pinpoint the exact cause of the error, or by the application to prompt an appropriate response from the user. (Ex. Deceased date must be greater than or equal to birth date).\r\n\r\nApplication Error Parameter: A receiving application encounters an error during processing of a transaction. In addition to an error code, the application provides an error parameter that gives greater detail as to the exact nature of the error. The receiving application looks up the message corresponding to the error code, substitutes in the parameter, and displays the resulting message to the user.\r\n\r\nDiagnostic Information: While processing a transaction, a receiving application encounters an exception. When the exception is thrown, it provides a volume of detailed information relating to the error encountered. The receiving application captures the information and sends it in its response. The user reports the error to the help desk, and on request, faxes a copy of the diagnostic information to assist analyzing the problem.\r\n\r\nUser Message: A user executes an application function that generates a transaction that is sent to another application for further processing. During this processing, the receiving application encounters an error and, as part of the error handling routine, retrieves a User Message that it returns in its response. The originating application receives the error and displays it to the end user with the intent that the error condition can be resolved and the user can re-execute the function without error.\r\n\r\nInform Person Code: After submitting a dispense transaction, a response is returned to the user indicating that the patient may be abusing drugs. Given the sensitivity of this warning, the error is returned with an indicator stating that the patient should not be informed of the error with the implication that steps should be taken to rule out or confirm the warning.\r\n\r\nOverride Type: If a business rule states that a prescription on hold cannot be dispensed, an override type might be \"Dispense Held Prescription\" to allow the prescription to be dispensed in exception to the rule.\r\n\r\nOverride Reason Codes: A patient is given a prescription; however, before completing the prescription, the remaining pills are spoiled. The patient returns to their pharmacy and explains the situation to their pharmacist. The pharmacist decides to replace the spoiled drugs; however, when attempting to record the event, a message is returned indicating that the dispense would exceed the maximum amount prescribed. The pharmacist overrides the rule and specifies an Override Reason Code indicating a replacement of lost product.\r\n\r\nHelp Desk Contact: Help desk contact information is stored in a database. When an application error is encountered, the database is queried and the most current help desk contact information is returned in the error message. This is displayed to the user by the receiving application.\r\n\r\nBetter Error Location Information: Receiving system detects an error with the 3rd repetition of the ROL.4 (Role Person - XCN).16 (Name Context – CE).4(Alternate Identifier – CWE). The application identifies the specific repetition and component when raising the error, simplifying diagnosis of the problem.\r\n\r\nSupport for multiple Error Locations: Two fields are marked as conditional, with the condition that one of the two must be specified. The sending application leaves both blank. The receiving application detects the problem, and sends back a single error indicating that one of the fields must be filled in.

These are described in the succeeding sections.\r\n\r\nORC use notes\r\na) placer order groups\r\nThe Standard supports a mechanism to collect several orders together in a group. Most often this is used to represent an \"ordering session\" for a single patient.\r\nAn order group is a list of orders (ORCs) associated with an ORC-4-placer group number. A group is established when the placer supplies a placer group number with the original order. The order group consists of all the ORCs and order detail segments that have the same placer group number. Orders can be removed from the group using cancel, or added using the replacement or parent-child mechanisms. New orders cannot otherwise be added to the group.\r\n\r\nb) duplicate fields\r\nThe ORC is intended to uniformly define the fields that are common to all orders (i.e., requested services). Some ORC fields are duplicated in some order detail segments (e.g., OBR, RXO). For example, ORC-2-placer order number has the same meaning and purpose as OBR-2-placer order number field. This promotes upward compatibility with past versions and ASTM.\r\nThe rule for using these fields is that the value must appear in the order detail segment if it does not appear in the ORC. However, it is recommended to transmit the field value in both places to avoid confusion.\r\n\r\nc) parent/child – cancel, hold, discontinue\r\nDuring transmission of a request to cancel, hold, or discontinue a parent order, the request is intended to apply recursively to the parent order and all associated child orders.\r\nFor example:\r\n   1) An EKG application receives an order for three EKGs on successive mornings.\r\n   2) The EKG application creates three child orders, one for each requested EKG.\r\n   3) The first daily EKG has already been performed when a request is received to cancel the original parent order.

Very detailed explanatory notes are given at the end of this section.\r\n\r\nThis field may be considered the \"trigger event\" identifier for orders. The codes fall roughly into the following three categories:\r\n a) event request – Codes like \"NW\" (new order) and \"CA\" (cancel order request) are used to initiate an event .\r\n b) event acknowledgment – Codes like \"OK\" (order accepted) and \"CR\" (canceled as requested) are used to reply to the event request .\r\n c) event notification – Codes like \"OC\" (order canceled) and \"OD\" (order discontinued) are used to notify other applications that an event has occurred. No application reply is necessary.\r\n\r\nEvent request codes are intended to initiate an event. Event acknowledgment codes are intended to reply to an application that requested an event.
