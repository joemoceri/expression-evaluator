{"id":"SN","type":"DataType","name":"Structured Numeric","description":"The structured numeric data type is used to unambiguously express numeric clinical results along with qualifications. This enables receiving systems to store the components separately, and facilitates the use of numeric database queries.

If additional values are needed for the <comparator> and <separator/suffix> components, they should be submitted to HL7 for inclusion in the Standard.\r\n\r\nIf <num1> and <num2> are both non-null, then the separator/suffix must be non-null.
