{"id":"CNE","type":"DataType","name":"Coded with No Exceptions","description":"Specifies a coded element and its associated detail. The CNE data type is used when a required or mandatory coded field is needed. The specified HL7 table or imported or externally defined coding system must be used and may not be extended with local values. Text may not replace the code. A CNE field must have an HL7 defined or external table associated with it. A CNE field may be context sensitive such that a choice of explicit coding systems might be designated. This allows for realm and other types of specificity. Every effort will be made to enumerate the valid coding system(s) to be specified in the 3rd component, however, the standards body realizes that this is impossible to fully enumerate.","dataType":null,"dataTypeName":null,"length":705,"usage":null,"rpt":null,"tableId":null,"tableName":null,"sample":"","fields":[{"id":"CNE.1","type":"DataTypeComponent","position":"CNE.1","name":"Identifier","length":20,"usage":"R","rpt":"1","dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":"The first component contains the sequence of characters (the code) that uniquely identifies the item being referenced by the CNE.2.
