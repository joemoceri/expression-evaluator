There are three circumstances that involve requesting an order number (ORC-2-placer order number or ORC-3-filler order number): (1) When the filler application needs to request an ORC-3-filler order number from a centralized application (e.g., HIS). SN - The send order number code provides a mechanism for the filler to request an ORC-3-filler order number from some centralized application (called \"other\" in the table below), such as a central HIS, by sending an ORM message containing an ORC-1-order control value of SN. This ORC has a null ORC-3-filler order number and an ORC-2-placer order number created by the filler application when the filler originates the order. The order (SN type) message can be acknowledged by either one of two methods: a) By an order application acknowledgement message containing an ORC-1-order control value of OK. Then an unsolicited order message can be sent at a future time, containing an ORC with ORC-1-order control value of NA to provide the actual number assigned. b) By an order acknowledgement message containing an ORC-1-order control value of NA as described below. NA - The number assigned code allows the \"other\" application to notify the filler application of the newly-assigned filler order number.

The parent (PA) and child (CH) order control codes allow the spawning of \"child\" orders from a \"parent\" order without changing the parent (original order). One or more ORC segments with an ORC-1-order control value of PA are followed by one or more ORC segments with an ORC-1-order control value of CH. Whether OBR segments must be present is determined by the value of ORC-6-response flag. For example, suppose that a microbiology culture produced two organisms and corresponding susceptibility reports. Then the sequence of segments would be as follows: (see figure 4-4) The assignment of placer order numbers in the parent-child paradigm depends on whether the placer or filler creates the child order and in the latter case, on whether the placer supports the SN/NA transaction. If the placer creates the child orders it will assign their placer order numbers according to its usual procedures. If the filler creates the child orders there are two possibilities: each child will inherit the placer order number of its parent, or the filler will use the SN/NA transaction to request that the placer assign a placer order number. In either case, the filler application creates the filler order numbers of the children according to its usual procedures. Whenever a child order is transmitted in a message the ORC segment's ORC-8-parent is valued with the parent's filler order number (if originating from the filler) and with the parent's placer order number (if originating from the filler or if originating from the placer). The parent-child mechanism can be used to \"expand\" a parent order (e.g., an order for three EKGs on successive mornings)."},{"value":"PR","description":"Previous Results with new order/service","comment":"Placer Applications.

The observations-to-follow code is used to transmit patient-specific information with an order. An order detail segment (e.g., OBR) can be followed by one or more observation segments (OBX). Any observation that can be transmitted in an ORU message can be transmitted with this mechanism. When results are transmitted with an order, the results should immediately follow the order or orders that they support. The following example shows the sequence of segments for three Pharmacy orders. It illustrates the use of the RE code: SegmentOrder ControlCommentMSHPIDORCNWFirst new orderRXOFirst order segmentORCNW2nd new orderRXO2nd order segment[ORCREPatient-specific observation, optional in V 2.2 OBR]Observation OBR, optional in V 2.2OBXAn observation segmentOBXAnother observation segmentOBXAnother observation segmentOBXAnother observation segmentORCNW3rd orderRXO3rd order segment In this version of HL7, results can be transmitted with an order as one or more OBX segments without the necessity of including the ORC and OBR segments. Observations can be transmitted in an ORU message without using an ORC. There are times when it is necessary to transmit information not included in the OBR segments of the ORU message. In this case, it is recommended that the ORC be included in the ORU message. The order control value of RE is required only in ORM messages to indicate that an order is followed by observation results (OBX). The RE code is not necessary in the ORU message because it is expected that the OBR segments can be followed by observation results (OBX)."},{"value":"RF","description":"Refill order/service request","comment":"Placer or Filler Applications.

A replacement is the substitution of one or more orders for one or more previously ordered services. The replaced orders are treated as though they were canceled. If and when an ordered service can be replaced are local site-specific determinations. Use the parent/child order control codes if the site specifies that the original order must remain intact. Do not use the replacement codes under this circumstance. For each order to be replaced, use an ORC-1-order control value of RP (request for a replacement going to a filler) or RU (an unsolicited replacement created by the filler) used by the filler to notify the placer and/or other systems). By local agreement, the ORC segment (with RP or RU) may be followed by its original order detail segment. The ORC segments (with RP or RU) must be followed by an ORC segment with an ORC-1-order control value of RO (indicating the replacement order). By local agreement, the ORC with the RO value may be followed by an order detail segment. For example, suppose that an ancillary application were replacing two OBR orders with three different orders. The sequence of segments would be as follows: SegOrder ControlCommentORCRU1st replaced ORCOBR1st replaced order's detail segmentORCRU2nd replaced ORCOBR2nd replaced order's detail segmentORCRO1st replacement ORCOBR1st replacement order's detail segmentORCRO2nd replacement ORCOBR2nd replacement order's detail segmentORCRO3rd replacement ORCOBR3rd replacement order's detail segment Whether the OBR segments must be present is determined by the value of ORC-6-response flag. The described replacement method will handle all possible cases of replacement: one-into-one, many-into-one, one-into-many, and many-into-many. If the placer sent this request to the filler with two RPs, and this was a response back from the filler to the placer, the two RUs (replaced unsolicited) would be two RQs (replaced as requested).

In the case of the RU type (i.e., unsolicited replacement by the filler), the filler order number is generated as usual by the filler application. The placer order number is identical to the placer order number of the first transmitted ORC with an order control value of RU.
