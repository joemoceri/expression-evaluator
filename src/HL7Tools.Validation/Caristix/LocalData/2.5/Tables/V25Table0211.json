BIG-5 does not need an escape sequence. ASCII is a 7 bit character set, which means that the top bit of the byte is \"0\". The parser knows that when the top bit of the byte is \"0\", the character set is ASCII. When it is \"1\", the following bytes should be handled as 2 bytes (or more). No escape technique is needed. However, since some servers do not correctly interpret when they receive a top bit \"1\", it is advised, in internet RFC, to not use these kind of non-safe non-escape extension."},{"value":"CNS 11643-1992","description":"Code for Taiwanese Character Set (CNS 11643-1992)","comment":"Does not need an escape sequence."},{"value":"GB 18030-2000","description":"Code for Chinese Character Set (GB 18030-2000)","comment":"Does not need an escape sequence."},{"value":"ISO IR14","description":"Code for Information Exchange (one byte)(JIS X 0201-1976).","comment":"Note that the code contains a space, i.e. \"ISO IR14\"."},{"value":"ISO IR159","description":"Code of the supplementary Japanese Graphic Character set for information interchange (JIS X 0212-1990).","comment":"Note that the code contains a space, i.e. \"ISO IR159\"."},{"value":"ISO IR87","description":"Code for the Japanese Graphic Character set for information interchange (JIS X 0208-1990),","comment":"Note that the code contains a space, i.e. \"ISO IR87\".
