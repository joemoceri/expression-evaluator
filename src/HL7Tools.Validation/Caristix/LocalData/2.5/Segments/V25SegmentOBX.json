But the OBX can also be part of an observation order.  In this case, the OBX carries clinical information needed by the filler to interpret the observation the filler makes.  For example, an OBX is needed to report the inspired oxygen on an order for a blood oxygen to a blood gas lab, or to report the menstrual phase information which should be included on an order for a pap smear to a cytology lab.  Appendix 7A includes codes for identifying many of pieces of information needed by observation producing services to properly interpret a test result.
