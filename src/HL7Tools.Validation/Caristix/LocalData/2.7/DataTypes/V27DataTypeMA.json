{"id":"MA","type":"DataType","name":"Multiplexed Array","description":"This data type is used to represent channel-multiplexed waveform data. Assuming that fields that utilize this data type repeat and that Y represents the specific repetition, the components of the repetition will reflect sample Y from each channel.\r\n\r\nUsage Note: The MA data type is preferred when the signal recording device outputs the waveform data by time (all signal amplitudes at time sample 1, followed by all signal amplitudes at time sample 2, followed by all signal amplitudes at time sample 3, etc.). The typical count is 32, 64, or 128 channels. At the time of this writing, the MA data type is the one used by most commercial EEG instruments, while other electrophysiological instruments (such as evoked potential instruments) may use the NA data type. The MA data type is the \"natural\" one for multi-channel EEG instruments since the signal acquisition process involves digitizing each channel in succession as rapidly as possible, then after a fixed interval (like 0.004 seconds) digitizing all the channels again in succession, and repeating this every 0.004 seconds as long as the recording continues.\r\n\r\nUse Case: Commercial EEG instruments\r\n\r\nExample 1: 3 channels (identical), 6 time-samples\r\n|0^0^0~1^1^1~2^2^2~3^3^3~4^4^4~5^5^5|\r\n\r\nExample 2: 1 channel, 11 time-samples\r\n|0~1~2~3~4~5~6~7~8~9~10|","dataType":null,"dataTypeName":null,"length":0,"usage":null,"rpt":null,"tableId":null,"tableName":null,"sample":"","fields":[{"id":"MA.1","type":"DataTypeComponent","position":"MA.1","name":"Sample Y From Channel 1","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"NM","dataTypeName":"Numeric","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"MA.2","type":"DataTypeComponent","position":"MA.2","name":"Sample Y From Channel 2","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"NM","dataTypeName":"Numeric","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"MA.3","type":"DataTypeComponent","position":"MA.3","name":"Sample Y From Channel 3","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"NM","dataTypeName":"Numeric","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"MA.4","type":"DataTypeComponent","position":"MA.4","name":"Sample Y From Channel 4","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"NM","dataTypeName":"Numeric","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null}]}
