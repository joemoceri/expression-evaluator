{"id":"OPU_R25","msgStructId":"OPU_R25","eventDesc":"Unsolicited Population/Location-Based Laboratory Observation Message","description":"This message supports unsolicited population or location-based surveillance reporting to a central repository where the accession / visit may contain references to multiple patients, multiple specimens, non-patient specimens, and multiple orders per specimen.\r\n\r\nThis message structure represents the way most submissions to veterinary laboratories occur. There is a multi-tier hierarchy in which a single individual (for example, a veterinarian or an owner of a production facility) submits one or more specimen samples from one or more animals or non-living entity, such as environmental specimens or feed. This grouped submission of specimens from multiple animal 'patients' is usually referred to as an 'accession' which can be considered analogous to a 'visit' in the veterinary laboratory context. This is what accounts for the unusual structure where the PV1 segment precedes a repeatable ACCESSION_DETAIL group.\r\n\r\nSince specimens can originate from non-patients the PATIENT group is optional. This allows for specimens that are both associated with patients as well as those associated with non-patients to be included under the same accession (visit). Each specimen may have one or more orders assigned, each of which may have one or more individual results.\r\n\r\nThe OBX segment at the visit level provides the reason for submission. The repeatable PRT segment at the visit level represents the person(s) or organization submitting the request and other interested parties and locations who (that) play a role in the disposition of the accession/visit.\r\n\r\nThe NK1 segment contains owner and/or responsible party information for the patient and/or specimen.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_07"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","segmentId":"MSH","longName":"Message Header","description":"The MSH segment defines the intent, source, destination, and some specifics of the syntax of a message.","sample":"","chapters":["CH_02"],"fields":[{"id":"MSH.1","type":"Field","position":"MSH.1","name":"Field Separator","length":1,"usage":"R","rpt":"1","dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":"This field contains the separator between the segment ID and the first real field, MSH-2 Encoding Characters.

Refer to HL7 Table 0211 - Alternate Character Sets for valid values.\r\n\r\nAn HL7 message uses field MSH-18 Character Set to specify the character set(s) in use. Valid values for this field are specified in HL7 Table 0211 - Alternate Character Sets. MSH-18 Character Set may be left blank, or may contain one or more values delimited by the repetition separator. If the field is left blank, the character set in use is understood to be the 7-bit ASCII set, decimal 0 through decimal 127 (hex 00 through hex 7F). This default value may also be explicitly specified as ASCII.\r\n\r\nMore than one character set may be used in a message. The first occurrence, if supplied, of the MSH-18 must indicate the default encoding of the message. The second and subsequent occurrences of MSH-18-character set are used to specify additional character sets that are used.\r\nThe repetitions of this field to specify different character sets apply only to fields of the FT, ST and TX data types. See also section 2.7.2, \"Escape sequences supporting multiple character sets\".\r\n\r\nAny encoding system, single-byte or multi-byte, may be specified as the default character encoding in MSH-18 Character Set. If the default encoding is other than 7-bit ASCII, sites shall document this usage in the dynamic conformance profile or other implementation agreement. This is particularly effective in promoting interoperability between nations belonging to different HL7 Affiliates, while limiting the amount of testing required to determine the encoding of a message.\r\n\r\nBy using built-in language functions for string and character manipulation, parsers and applications need not be concerned whether a single or double byte character set is in use, provided it is applied to the entire message. Using a built in function to extract the fourth CHARACTER will always yield the field separator character, regardless of coding set. On the other hand, if the parser looks at the fourth BYTE, it is then limited to single byte character sets, since the fourth byte would contain the low order 8 bits of the character S in a double-byte system.\r\n\r\nNote: When describing encoding rules, this standard always speaks in terms of character position, not byte offset. Similarly, comparisons should be done on character values, not their byte equivalents. For this reason, delimiter characters should always have representation in the standard 7-bit ASCII character set, regardless of the actual character set being used, so that a search for the character CR (carriage return) can be performed.\r\n   a) if the field is not valued, the default single-byte character set (ASCII (\"ISO IR6\")) should be assumed. No other character sets are allowed in the message.\r\n   b) if the field repeats, but the first element is NULL (i.e., present but unvalued), the single-byte ASCII (\"ISO IR6\") is assumed as the default character set.\r\n   c) elements in the remainder of the sequence (i.e., elements 2..n) are alternate character sets that may be used.","sample":"","fields":[]},{"id":"MSH.19","type":"Field","position":"MSH.19","name":"Principal Language Of Message","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":"This field contains the principal language of the message.
