{"id":"PEX_P08","msgStructId":"PEX_P08","eventDesc":"Unsolicited update individual product experience report","description":"The primary application of this message is to transfer information related to an adverse event occurring while a patient was exposed to a product.\r\n\r\nThe PID segment provides the patient identification information including institutional identification numbers, date of birth and in the case of patients who die, information about their death. Patients are frequently identified only by their initials which can be represented in the PID segment, e.g., the initials JMO would appear as J^M^O in the name field of the PID segment. The EVN segment identifies the type of transaction that is being sent -- primarily it specifies who the sender is and implies which information is expected to be included in the message. A message sent from a healthcare provider, for example, might contain minimal information, while a message from a pharmaceutical manufacturer might contain nearly complete information.\r\n\r\nThe PES or Product Experience Sender segment provides information about the message sender and its knowledge of the event. The heart of the product experience message is the product experience observation (PEO) segment and the PCR segments clustered under it. The PEO segment identifies a clinical event and the PCR segments identify products which are potentially causally related to the event. There may be more than one product which is potentially related to the event so multiple PCR segments can be included. RXE and RXR segments can be repeated and provide information about the products the patient was exposed to at the time of the event (typically excluding those used to treat the event). Details about the administration of the products identified in the PCR segments should be described with RXE and RXR segments. Repeated PRB segments provide information about diagnoses which represent comorbid conditions. The repeated OBX segments are used to send patient observations such as height, weight, last menstrual period, and laboratory results. Analytical commentary can be included in the NTE segment. This commentary will typically be the sender’s analysis of the event and the potentially causally related products. Finally, the CSR and CSP segments can optionally be included if the event occurred during a formal clinical trial in order to describe the trial.\r\n\r\nWhen a product experience relates to an exposure which occurred indirectly (transmammary or transplacentally for example), the individual experiencing the adverse effect — the fetus or child — would be described in the PID segment and the individual via which they are exposed in the NK1 segment. The first set of RXE segments would typically indicate the drugs which to which the fetus or child was exposed. Additional codes for the route are defined in this Appendix to allow the suspected routes of exposure to be represented. The second set of RXE/RXR segment - those clustered under the NK1 segment - would represent the route by which the mother or father was exposed to the drug. Early spontaneous abortion would normally be treated as an adverse effect on the mother rather than on the fetus, and the PID would refer to the mother. The second set of PRB/OBX segments reflects the problems/observations associated with the individual via which they were exposed.\r\n\r\nEach message contains information about a single case including one patient (PID), at least one sender (PES), one or more events (PEO) and one or more suspected products (PCR and RXE/RXA) for a minimal message. The structure of the message allows actual administration information to be sent in the RXA if known; if administration information is unavailable, or the adverse reaction cannot be related to a single administration event, the RXE segment can be used to send prescription level information. Additional information may be included based on availability and regulatory requirements.\r\n\r\nThe MSH segment specifies the character set (MSH-18) and the language (MSH-19) used in the PEX message.\r\nThe PEX message is designed to accommodate required reporting of adverse product events to the responsible regulatory agencies. In the United States, the paper version of this report is Medwatch.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_07"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","segmentId":"MSH","longName":"Message Header","description":"The MSH segment defines the intent, source, destination, and some specifics of the syntax of a message.","sample":"","chapters":["CH_02"],"fields":[{"id":"MSH.1","type":"Field","position":"MSH.1","name":"Field Separator","length":1,"usage":"R","rpt":"1","dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":"This field contains the separator between the segment ID and the first real field, MSH-2 Encoding Characters.

Refer to HL7 Table 0211 - Alternate Character Sets for valid values.\r\n\r\nAn HL7 message uses field MSH-18 Character Set to specify the character set(s) in use. Valid values for this field are specified in HL7 Table 0211 - Alternate Character Sets. MSH-18 Character Set may be left blank, or may contain one or more values delimited by the repetition separator. If the field is left blank, the character set in use is understood to be the 7-bit ASCII set, decimal 0 through decimal 127 (hex 00 through hex 7F). This default value may also be explicitly specified as ASCII.\r\n\r\nMore than one character set may be used in a message. The first occurrence, if supplied, of the MSH-18 must indicate the default encoding of the message. The second and subsequent occurrences of MSH-18-character set are used to specify additional character sets that are used.\r\nThe repetitions of this field to specify different character sets apply only to fields of the FT, ST and TX data types. See also section 2.7.2, \"Escape sequences supporting multiple character sets\".\r\n\r\nAny encoding system, single-byte or multi-byte, may be specified as the default character encoding in MSH-18 Character Set. If the default encoding is other than 7-bit ASCII, sites shall document this usage in the dynamic conformance profile or other implementation agreement. This is particularly effective in promoting interoperability between nations belonging to different HL7 Affiliates, while limiting the amount of testing required to determine the encoding of a message.\r\n\r\nBy using built-in language functions for string and character manipulation, parsers and applications need not be concerned whether a single or double byte character set is in use, provided it is applied to the entire message. Using a built in function to extract the fourth CHARACTER will always yield the field separator character, regardless of coding set. On the other hand, if the parser looks at the fourth BYTE, it is then limited to single byte character sets, since the fourth byte would contain the low order 8 bits of the character S in a double-byte system.\r\n\r\nNote: When describing encoding rules, this standard always speaks in terms of character position, not byte offset. Similarly, comparisons should be done on character values, not their byte equivalents.

A given institution, or group of intercommunicating institutions, should establish a list of assigning authorities that may be potential assignors of patient identification (and other important identification) numbers.  The list will be one of the institution's master dictionary lists.  Since third parties (other than the assignors of patient identification numbers) may send or receive HL7 messages containing patient identification numbers, the assigning authority in the patient identification numbers may not be the same as the sending and receiving systems identified in the MSH.  The assigning authority must be unique across applications at a given site.  This field is required in HL7 implementations that have more than a single Patient Administration application assigning such numbers. The assigning authority and identifier type codes are strongly recommended for all CX data types.\r\n\r\nWith HL7 V2.3, the nomenclature for the fourth component of the patient identifiers was changed from \"assigning facility ID\" to \"assigning authority\".  While the identifier may be unique to a given healthcare facility (for example, a medical record assigned by facility A in Hospital XYZ), the identifier might also be assigned at a system level (for example a corporate person index or enterprise number spanning multiple facilities) or by a government entity, for example a nationally assigned unique individual identifier.  While a facility is usually an assigning authority, not all assigning authorities are facilities.  Therefore, the fourth component is referred to as an assigning authority, but retains backward compatibility using the construct of the HD data type (see the note in chapter 2).  Additionally, CX data types support the use of assigning facility (HD) as the sixth component.","sample":"","chapters":["CH_03"],"fields":[{"id":"PID.1","type":"Field","position":"PID.1","name":"Set Id - Pid","length":4,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"SI","dataTypeName":"Sequence Id","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":"This field contains the number that identifies this transaction.
