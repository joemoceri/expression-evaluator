If this is the case, the mechanism of product transmission is identified in this field, using the valid values in HL7 Table 0253 - Indirect exposure mechanism . If this field is populated, the identity of the person through whom the product was transmitted is contained in NK1 and RXE segments which follow.","sample":"","fields":[]}]}
