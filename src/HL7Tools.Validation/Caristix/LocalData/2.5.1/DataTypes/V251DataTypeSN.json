{"id":"SN","type":"DataType","name":"Structured Numeric","description":"The structured numeric data type is used to unambiguously express numeric clinical results along with qualifications. This enables receiving systems to store the components separately, and facilitates the use of numeric database queries. The corresponding sets of values indicated with the <comparator> and <separator/suffix> components are intended to be the authoritative and complete set of values. If additional values are needed for the <comparator> and <separator/suffix> components, they should be submitted to HL7 for inclusion in the Standard.\r\n\r\nExamples: \r\n|>^100|   (greater than 100) \r\n|^100^-^200|  (equal to range of 100 through 200) ","dataType":null,"dataTypeName":null,"length":36,"usage":null,"rpt":null,"tableId":null,"tableName":null,"sample":"","fields":[{"id":"SN.1","type":"DataTypeComponent","position":"SN.1","name":"Comparator","length":2,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":"Defined as greater than, less than, greater than or equal, less than or equal, equal, and not equal, respectively (= \">\" or \"<\" or \">=\" or \"<=\" or \"=\" or \"<>\"","sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"SN.2","type":"DataTypeComponent","position":"SN.2","name":"Num1","length":15,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"NM","dataTypeName":"Numeric","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":"A number.","sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"SN.3","type":"DataTypeComponent","position":"SN.3","name":"Separator/Suffix","length":1,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":"\"-\" or \"+\" or \"/\" or \".\" or \":\"","sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"SN.4","type":"DataTypeComponent","position":"SN.4","name":"Num2","length":15,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"NM","dataTypeName":"Numeric","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":"A number or null depending on the measurement.","sample":null,"fields":null}]}
