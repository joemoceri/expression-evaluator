{"id":"HD","type":"DataType","name":"Hierarchic Designator","description":"The basic definition of the HD is that it identifies an (administrative or system or application or other) entity that has responsibility for managing or assigning a defined set of instance identifiers (such as placer or filler number, patient identifiers, provider identifiers, etc.). This entity could be a particular health care application such as a registration system that assigns patient identifiers, a governmental entity such as a licensing authority that assigns professional identifiers or drivers license numbers, or a facility where such identifiers are assigned.\r\n\r\nNote:  The HD is used in fields that in earlier versions of HL7 used the IS data type. Thus, a single component HD (only the first component valued) will look like a simple IS data type for older systems expecting a single component in the place of the HD data type. \r\n\r\nIf the first component for the HD data type is present, the second and third components are optional. If the third component is present, then the second must also be present (although in this case the first is optional). The second and third components must either both be valued (both non-null), or both be not valued (both null).  \r\n\r\nThis means that if all three components of the HD are valued, the entity identified by the first component is the same as the entity identified by components two and three taken together. However, implementers may choose, by site agreement, to specify that if all three components of the HD are valued, the first component defines a member in the set defined by the second and third components.","dataType":null,"dataTypeName":null,"length":227,"usage":null,"rpt":null,"tableId":null,"tableName":null,"sample":"","fields":[{"id":"HD.1","type":"DataTypeComponent","position":"HD.1","name":"Namespace Id","length":20,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"IS","dataTypeName":"Coded value for user-defined tables","tableId":"0300","tableName":"Namespace ID","description":"Namespace ID is used as the HL7 identifier for the user-defined table of values for this component.\r\n\r\nNote: When the HD is used in a given segment (either as a field or as a component of another data type) this table may be re-defined (given a different user-defined table number and name) by the technical committee responsible for that segment.","sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"HD.2","type":"DataTypeComponent","position":"HD.2","name":"Universal Id","length":199,"usage":"C","rpt":"1","dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":"The HDs second component, <universal ID> (UID), is a string formatted according to the scheme defined by the third component, <universal ID type> (UID type).
