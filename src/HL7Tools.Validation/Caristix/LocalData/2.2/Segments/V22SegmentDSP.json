The ancillary response will contain the report referenced by this result ID (e.g., accession number).  The ancillary should correlate the result ID with DSP-4-logical break point as follows: If more than one line of text is sent per result, DSP-5-result ID should be only non-null for a DSP segment that contains a non-null DSP-4-logical break point.  This field may be broken into components by local agreement.  A common example might be to include placer order number, filler order number, and universal service identifier.
