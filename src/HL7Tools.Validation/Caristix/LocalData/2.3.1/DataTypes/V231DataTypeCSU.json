The sensitivity incorporates both the amplifier gain and the actual ADC resolution.  It does not, however, relate to the vertical scaling of a waveform display (it is, for example, a measure of voltage, not voltage per unit distance).  For channels recording potential differences between two electrodes using a differential amplifier, a positive sensitivity indicates that a number in the waveform data which is greater than the channel baseline represents a potential at the first electrode which is more positive than that at the second electrode.  A negative sensitivity indicates that a number in the waveform data which is greater than the channel baseline corresponds to a potential at the first electrode which is more negative than that at the second electrode.","sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"CSU.2","type":"DataTypeComponent","position":"CSU.2","name":"Unit Of Measure Identifier","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":"A units designation (for example, uv = microvolt, mv = millivolt, v = volt, pal = pascal, or mm(hg) = millimeters of mercury) from a designated system of units, such as the ISO+ extension of the standard SI single case unit abbreviations presented as Figure 7-13 in Section  7.3.2.6.1, “Identifying reporting units,” or the ANSI+ U.S. customary unit abbreviations, a superset of the ANSI standard which appears in Figure 710.
