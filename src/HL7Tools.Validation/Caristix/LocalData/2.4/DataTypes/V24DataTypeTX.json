{"id":"TX","type":"DataType","name":"Text Data","description":"String data meant for user display (on a terminal or printer).  Such data would not necessarily be left justified since leading spaces may contribute greatly to the clarity of the presentation to the user.  Because this type of data is intended for display, it may contain certain escape character sequences designed to control the display.  Escape sequence formatting is defined later in this chapter in Section 2.10 “Use of escape sequences in text fields.”  Leading spaces should be included.  Trailing spaces should be removed.  \r\n\r\nSince TX data is intended for display purposes, the repeat delimiter, when used with a TX data field, implies a series of repeating lines to be displayed on a printer or terminal.  Therefore, the repeat delimiters are regarded as paragraph terminators or hard carriage returns (e.g., they would display as though a CR/LF were inserted in the text (DOS type system) or as though a LF were inserted into the text (UNIX style system)).\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n|  leading spaces are allowed.|","dataType":null,"dataTypeName":null,"length":65536,"usage":null,"rpt":null,"tableId":null,"tableName":null,"sample":"","fields":[]}
