{"id":"CD","type":"DataType","name":"Channel Definition","description":"This data type is used for labeling of digital waveform data.  It defines a recording channel which is associated with one of the values in each time sample of waveform data.  Each channel has a number (which generally defines its position in a multichannel display) and an optional name or label (also used in displays).  One or two named waveform sources may also be associated with a channel (providing for the use of differential amplifiers with two inputs). The other components of the channel definition data type are optional.
