{"id":"CM_CSU","type":"DataType","name":"Channel Sensitivity/units","description":"This CM data type defines the channel sensitivity (gain) and the units in which it is measured.  This component consists of up to seven subcomponents, separated from each other by subcomponent delimiters (&).

The sensitivity incorporates both the amplifier gain and the actual ADC resolution.  It does not, however, relate to the vertical scaling of a waveform display (it is, for example, a measure of voltage, not voltage per unit distance).  For channels recording potential differences between two electrodes using a differential amplifier, a positive sensitivity indicates that a number in the waveform data which is greater than the channel baseline represents a potential at the first electrode which is more positive than that at the second electrode.  A negative sensitivity indicates that a number in the waveform data which is greater than the channel baseline corresponds to a potential at the first electrode which is more negative than that at the second electrode","sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"CM_CSU.2","type":"DataTypeComponent","position":"CM_CSU.2","name":"Unit Identifier","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"ID","dataTypeName":"Coded values for HL7 tables","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":"A units designation (for example, uv = microvolt, mv = millivolt, v = volt, pal = pascal, or mm(hg) = millimeters of mercury) from a designated system of units, such as the ISO+ extension of the standard SI single case unit abbreviations presented as Figure 7-13 in Section  7.3.2.6.1, “Identifying reporting units,” or the ANSI+ U.S. customary unit abbreviations, a superset of the ANSI standard which appears in Figure 7-10.
