But the OBX can also be part of an observation order (see Section 4.2, “Order Message Definitions”).  In this case, the OBX carries clinical information needed by the filler to interpret the observation the filler makes.  For example, an OBX is needed to report the inspired oxygen on an order for a blood oxygen to a blood gas lab, or to report the menstrual phase information which should be included on an order for a pap smear to a cytology lab.  Appendix 7A includes codes for identifying many of pieces of information needed by observation producing services to properly interpret a test result.

It must be valued if OBX-11Observation result status is not valued with an ‘X”.  If the value is CE then the result must be a coded entry.  When the value type is TX or FT then the results are bulk text.  The valid values for the value type of an observation are listed in HL7 table 0125 - Value type. \r\n\r\nThe observation value must be represented according to the format for the data type defined in Chapter 2, Section 2.8, “Data Types.”  For example, a PN consists of 6 components, separated by component delimiters.  \r\n\r\nAlthough NM is a valid type, observations which are usually reported as numbers will sometimes have the string (ST) data type because non-numeric characters are often reported as part of the result, e.g., >300 to indicate the result was off-scale for the instrument.  In the example, \">300\", \">\" is a symbol and the digits are considered a numeric value.  However, this usage of the ST type should be discouraged since the SN (structured numeric) data type now accommodates such reporting and, in addition, permits the receiving system to interpret the magnitude. \r\n\r\nAll HL7 data types are valid, and are included in Table 0125 except CM, CQ, SI, and ID.  For a CM definition to have meaning, the specifics about the CM must be included in the field definition.  OBX-5-observation value is a general field definition that is influenced by the data type OBX-3, so CMs are undefined in this context.   CQ is invalid because units for OBX-5-observation value are always specified explicitly in an OBX segment with OBX-6 units.  SI is invalid because it only applied to HL7 message segments, and ID because it requires a constant field definition. \r\n\r\nThe RP value (reference pointer) must be used if the actual observation value is not sent in OBX but exists somewhere else.  For example, if the observation consists of an image (document or medical), the image itself cannot be sent in OBX.  The sending system may in that case opt to send a reference pointer.
