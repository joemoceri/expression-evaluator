{"id":"NMR_N01","msgStructId":"NMR_N01","eventDesc":"Application management response","description":"The N01 event signifies when the NMQ (Application Management Query) message is used by one application to make application control-level requests for information or action to another application.  It has three segments, the NCK segment (system clock), the NST segment (application control-level statistics), and the NSC segment (application control-level status change). At least one of these three segments must be present in the NMQ message. If a segment is present in the NMQ message, the corresponding segment needs to be present in the NMR message to return the requested data or status.
