{"id":"RSP_K11","msgStructId":"RSP_K11","eventDesc":"Segment Pattern Response in Response to QBP_Q11","description":"The RSP_K11 supports a Segment Pattern Response to the QBP and contains the MSH, MSA, ERR, QAK, QPD, variable content segments, and the DSC.  Its default trigger event is K11.  A standard or site-defined response may use this trigger event or may specify a unique trigger event value in its Conformance Statement.  If a unique trigger event value is chosen for a site-defined response, that value must begin with Z.\r\n\r\nNote on RSP:  The conformance statement for each QBP/RSP pair shall specify an explicit segment pattern grammar in place of the ellipses shown above in the RSP_K11 grammar.
