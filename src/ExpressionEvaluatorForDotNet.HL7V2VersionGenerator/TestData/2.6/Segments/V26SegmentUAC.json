{"id":"UAC","segmentId":"UAC","longName":"User Authentication Credential","description":"This optional segment provides user authentication credentials, a Kerberos Service Ticket or SAML assertion, to be used by the receiving system to obtain user identification data. Refer to HL7 Table 0615 - User Authentication Credential Type Code . It is to be used in when the receiving application system requires the sending system to provide end-user identification for accountability or access control in interactive applications. Since user authentication implementations often limit the time period for validity of the session authentication credentials, this segment is not intended for use in non-interactive applications.\r\n\r\nNote: The UAC segment is defined for use within simple protocols, such as MLLP, that do not have user authentication semantics. Implementations that use WSDL/SOAP, or similar protocols, to envelope HL7 should employ the user authentication semantics and data structures available within the scope of those protocols rather than the UAC segment.
