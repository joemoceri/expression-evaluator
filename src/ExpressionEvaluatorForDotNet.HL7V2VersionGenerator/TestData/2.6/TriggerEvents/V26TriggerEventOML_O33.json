{"id":"OML_O33","msgStructId":"OML_O33","eventDesc":"Laboratory Order for Multiple Orders Related to a Single Specimen ","description":"The trigger event for this message is any change to a laboratory order.  Such changes include submission of new orders, cancellations, updates, etc., where multiple orders are associated with a single sample which may be carried in multiple containers.  OML messages can originate also with a placer, filler, or an interested third party.\r\n\r\nThis allows for a Specimen-centric message with multiple orders per specimen grouped by the specimen.\r\n\r\nThe following message structure may be used for the communication of laboratory and other order messages and must be used for lab automation messages where the message requires Specimen/container information to group a number of orders.  While the ORM message with the OBR segment can be used for backwards compatibility for general lab messages, only the OML message should be used to take advantage of the specimen and container extensions required in laboratory automation.\r\n\r\nIn relationship to triggers O21, O33, and O35, this message/trigger (O33) should be used where a specimen, with optional multiple containers, may have multiple orders to be communicated.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_04"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","segmentId":null,"longName":"Message
