When this \"give\" (i.e., administration) information needs to be transmitted from the pharmacy or treatment application to another application, it is done with the RGV message. \r\n\r\nThe RGV message uses the RXG segment to record drug or treatment administration instructions.  It may carry information about a single scheduled administration on a drug or treatment, or it may carry information about multiple administrations.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_04"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","segmentId":null,"longName":"Message
