The CWE data type is used when 1) more than one table may be applicable or 2) the specified HL7 or externally defined table may be extended with local values or 3) when text is in place, the code may be omitted.\r\n\r\nThe presence of two sets of equivalent codes in this data type is semantically different from a repetition of a CWE-type field. With repetition, several distinct codes (with distinct meanings) may be transmitted.\r\n\r\nUsage Notes:  The CWE data type should be used for coded fields with one or more of the following characteristics:\r\n - The identifier code (CWE.1) component is optional\r\n - The set of allowable values from which the identifier code is drawn may be extended on a site-specific basis\r\n - An exception identifier code may be encountered; that is, a code that is not defined in the value set (either model or site-extended).\r\n\r\nThis is in contrast to the CNE data type, which requires a code from a non-extendable value set be sent in the identifier code component (CNE.1) in all cases (except, of course, if the entire field is empty and defined as optional at the segment level).\r\n\r\nAs of v2.7 a third tuple, formerly known as triplet, has been added  to the CWE data type.
