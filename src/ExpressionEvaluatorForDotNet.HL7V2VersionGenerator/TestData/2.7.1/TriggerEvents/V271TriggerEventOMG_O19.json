{"id":"OMG_O19","msgStructId":"OMG_O19","eventDesc":"General clinical order","description":"The function of this message is to initiate the transmission of information about a general clinical order that uses the OBR segment. OMG messages can originate also with a placer, filler, or an interested third party.\r\nThe trigger event for this message is any change to a general clinical order. Such changes include submission of new orders, cancellations, updates, patient and non-patient-specific orders, etc.\r\n\r\nThis trigger includes segments identified as being for 'previous results.' These segments allow the sending system to include demographic and/or result information from previous result reports when they are related to the current order.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n- Diagnostic laboratories referring tests to another lab for either confirmation of results (HIV, etc.) or due to not being equipped to do the tests (genetic testing, etc.).\r\n- Diagnostic laboratories sending test results to Knowledge Bases for the automated generation of diagnostic comments for inclusion into the lab report.\r\n\r\nThe CTD segment in this trigger is used to transmit temporary patient contact details specific to this order.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_04"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","segmentId":null,"longName":"Message
