{"id":"UB1","segmentId":"UB1","longName":"UB82 Data","description":"The UB1 segment contains the data necessary to complete UB82 bills specific to the United States; other realms may choose to implement using regional code sets. Only UB82 fields that do not exist in other HL7 defined segments appear in this segment. Patient Name and Date of Birth are required for UB82 billing; however, they are included in the PID segment and therefore do not appear here. The UB codes listed as examples are not an exhaustive or current list. Refer to a UB specification for additional information.\r\n\r\nThe Uniform Billing segments are specific to the US and may not be implemented in non-US systems.
