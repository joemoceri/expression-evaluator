{"id":"ADT_A48","msgStructId":"ADT_A48","eventDesc":"Change Alternate Patient ID","description":"Event A48 has been retained for backward compatibility only, corresponding with PID-4 - Alternate Patient ID-PID, which is also retained for backward compatibility.  From V2.3.1 onwards, event A47 (change patient identifier list) should be used instead.  A change has been done at the alternate patient identifier level.  That is, a PID-4 - Alternate Patient ID-PID has been found to be incorrect and has been changed. \r\n\r\nAn A48 event is used to signal a change of an incorrectly assigned alternate patient identifier value.  The “incorrect source alternate patient ID” value is stored in the MRG segment (MRG-2 - Prior Alternate Patient ID) and is to be changed to the “correct target alternate patient ID” value stored in the PID segment (PID-4 - Alternate Patient ID-PID).
