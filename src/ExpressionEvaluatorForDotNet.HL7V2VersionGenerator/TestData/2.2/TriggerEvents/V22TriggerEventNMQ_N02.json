{"id":"NMQ_N02","msgStructId":"NMQ_N02","eventDesc":"Network Management Query","description":"The NMQ (Network Management Query) message is used by one system to make system-level requests for information or action to another system. It has three segments, the NCK segment (network clock), the NST segment (network statistics), and the NSC segment (network status change). An example of the last type, NSC (network status change) would be an application or system startup/shut down request. At least one of these three segments must be present in the NMQ message. If a segment is present in the NMQ message, the corresponding segment needs to be present in the NMR message to return the requested data or status.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_02"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","segmentId":null,"longName":"Message Header","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"segmentId":null,"longName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"QRD","segmentId":null,"longName":"Query Definition","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"2","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"QRF","segmentId":null,"longName":"Query Filter","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"3","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"segmentId":null,"longName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"R","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"NCK","segmentId":null,"longName":"System Clock","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"4","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NST","segmentId":null,"longName":"Statistics","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"5","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NSC","segmentId":null,"longName":"Status Change","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"6","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}]}]}
