{"id":"TS","type":"DataType","name":"Time Stamp","description":"Contains the exact time of an event, including the date and time.  Time stamp fields are always in the format: \r\n \r\n YYYYMMDD[HHMM[SS[.SSSS]]][+/-ZZZZ]^<degree of precision>   \r\n \r\nThe date portion of a time stamp follows the rules of a date field and the time portion follows the rules of a time field.  When used as a birthdate, the HHMM portion is optional.  If not present the HHMM portion will default to 0000, i.e., midnight of the day just beginning.  The specific data representations used in the HL7 encoding rules are compatible with ISO 8824-1987(E).  An optional second component indicates the degree of precision of the date (Y = year, L = month, D = day, H = hour, M = minute, S = second). (Maximum length of field is 26). \r\n\r\nExamples: \r\n \r\n|17760704010159-0600|1:01:59 on July 4, 1776 in the Eastern Standard Time zone. \r\n \r\n|17760704010159-0500|1:01:59 on July 4, 1776 in the Eastern Daylight Saving Time zone. \r\n \r\n|198807050000|  Midnight of the night extending from July 4 to July 5, 1988 in the local time zone of the sender.  \r\n \r\n|198807050000^D| Same as prior example, but precision extends only to the day.  Could be used for a birthdate.
