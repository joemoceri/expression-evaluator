{"id":"ADT_A61","msgStructId":"ADT_A61","eventDesc":"Change consulting doctor","description":"An A61 event is used as a result of a change in the consulting physician(s) for the treatment of a patient.\r\n\r\nWhen other important fields change, it is recommended that the A08 (update patient information) event be used in addition. If the Patient Administration system allows demographics to change at the same time (for example an address change), two messages (an A61 followed by an A08) should be sent.\r\n\r\nThe new consulting doctor(s) of the patient should appear in the PV1-9 - Consulting Doctor and may appear in a role segment per new consulting physician.\r\n\r\nIf a consulting doctor stops being consulting doctor for this patient-visit, the end date/time can be sent in the ROL-6 - Role End Date/Time.\r\n\r\nFor example, an A61 event can be used to notify the billing system that doctors' fees for being a consulting doctor, should be billed to the new doctor(s) starting from the timestamp in the message.\r\n\r\nIt is recommended that field EVN-6 - Event Occurred contains the date/time the event actually occurred to the patient.\r\n\r\nThe ROL - Role Segment is used in this message to communicate providers not specified elsewhere. Person level providers with an ongoing relationship are reported in the ROL segment following the PID/PD1 segments. Providers corresponding to the PV1 data are reported in the ROL segment following the PV1/PV2 segments. Providers related to a specific procedure are reported in the ROL segment following the PR1 segment. Providers related to a specific insurance are reported in the ROL segment following the IN1/IN2/IN3 segments. To communicate the begin- and end-date of the provider, use the ROL-5 - Role Begin Date/Time and the ROL-6 - Role End Date/Time in the ROL segment, with the applicable ROL-3 - Role Code. Refer to Chapter 15 for the definition of the ROL segment.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_03"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","segmentId":null,"longName":"Message Header","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"SFT","segmentId":null,"longName":"Software Segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"2","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"UAC","segmentId":null,"longName":"User Authentication Credential Segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"3","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"EVN","segmentId":null,"longName":"Event Type","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"4","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PID","segmentId":null,"longName":"Patient Identification","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"5","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PD1","segmentId":null,"longName":"Patient Additional Demographic","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"6","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"ROL","segmentId":null,"longName":"Role","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"7","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PV1","segmentId":null,"longName":"Patient Visit","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"8","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"ROL","segmentId":null,"longName":"Role","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"9","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PV2","segmentId":null,"longName":"Patient Visit - Additional Information","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"10","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}
