{"id":"MFK_M14","msgStructId":"MFK_M14","eventDesc":"Site Defined Master File Application Acknowledgment","description":"The MFN Site defined master file notification transaction is used where the master file is not a simple one (as defined for MFN^M13) and is not a transaction type currently defined by HL7, but rather requires one or more HL7 and/or 'Z' segments to carry the master file information.\r\n\r\nThe master file record identified by the MFE segment is contained in Z-segments immediately following the MFE segment, and is denoted by \"...\" in the MFN abstract message definition given above.  This record may be either a flat record contained in a single segment, or a complex record needing more than a single segment to carry its data and (usually hierarchical) structure.\r\n\r\nThe definition of this transaction and the associated abstract message structure code (as defined in MSH-9 - Message Type, denoted by MFN_Znn above) are subject to site negotiation.  Refer to Chapter 2, section 2.17, \"Local Extension\" for additional information on 'Z' abstract message structure code definition.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_08"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","segmentId":null,"longName":"Message Header","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"SFT","segmentId":null,"longName":"Software Segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"2","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"UAC","segmentId":null,"longName":"User Authentication Credential Segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"3","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"MSA","segmentId":null,"longName":"Message Acknowledgment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"4","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"ERR","segmentId":null,"longName":"Error","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"5","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"MFI","segmentId":null,"longName":"Master File Identification","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"6","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"MFA","segmentId":null,"longName":"Master File Acknowledgment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"7","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}
