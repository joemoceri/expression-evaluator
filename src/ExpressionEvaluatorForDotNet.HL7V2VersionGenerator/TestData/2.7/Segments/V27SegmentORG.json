{"id":"ORG","segmentId":"ORG","longName":"Practitioner Organization Unit Segment","description":"The ORG segment relates a practitioner to an organization unit and adds detailed information regarding the practitioner's practicing specialty in that organization unit.  An ORG segment may optionally follow an STF segment.  An ORG segment must always have been preceded by a corresponding STF segment.  If no organization unit is specified, this segment is used to relate practitioners with their practicing specialties, including effective and end dates.  When it is not necessary to record organization unit or dates associated with the practicing specialty, this data is recorded in PRA-3-Practitioner Category.","sample":"","chapters":["CH_15"],"fields":[{"id":"ORG.1","type":"Field","position":"ORG.1","name":"Set Id - Org","length":4,"usage":"R","rpt":"1","dataType":"SI","dataTypeName":"Sequence Id","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"ORG.2","type":"Field","position":"ORG.2","name":"Organization Unit Code","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","tableId":"0405","tableName":"Organization Unit","description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"ORG.3","type":"Field","position":"ORG.3","name":"Organization Unit Type Code","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","tableId":"0474","tableName":"Organization Unit Type","description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"ORG.4","type":"Field","position":"ORG.4","name":"Primary Org Unit Indicator","length":1,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"ID","dataTypeName":"Coded Value For Hl7 Defined Tables","tableId":"0136","tableName":"Yes/no Indicator","description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"ORG.5","type":"Field","position":"ORG.5","name":"Practitioner Org Unit Identifier","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"CX","dataTypeName":"Extended Composite Id With Check Digit","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"ORG.6","type":"Field","position":"ORG.6","name":"Health Care Provider Type Code","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","tableId":"0452","tableName":"Health Care Provider Type Code","description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"ORG.7","type":"Field","position":"ORG.7","name":"Health Care Provider Classification Code","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","tableId":"0453","tableName":"Health Care Provider Classification","description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"ORG.8","type":"Field","position":"ORG.8","name":"Health Care Provider Area Of Specialization Code","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","tableId":"0454","tableName":"Health Care Provider Area of Specialization","description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"ORG.9","type":"Field","position":"ORG.9","name":"Effective Date Range","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"DR","dataTypeName":"Date/time Range","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"ORG.10","type":"Field","position":"ORG.10","name":"Employment Status Code","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","tableId":"0066","tableName":"Employment Status","description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"ORG.11","type":"Field","position":"ORG.11","name":"Board Approval Indicator","length":1,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"ID","dataTypeName":"Coded Value For Hl7 Defined Tables","tableId":"0136","tableName":"Yes/no Indicator","description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"ORG.12","type":"Field","position":"ORG.12","name":"Primary Care Physician Indicator","length":1,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"ID","dataTypeName":"Coded Value For Hl7 Defined Tables","tableId":"0136","tableName":"Yes/no Indicator","description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"ORG.13","type":"Field","position":"ORG.13","name":"Cost Center Code","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","tableId":"0539","tableName":"Cost Center Code","description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null}],"sequence":null,"usage":null,"rpt":null,"isGroup":false,"segments":null}
