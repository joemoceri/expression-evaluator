{"id":"BAR_P02","msgStructId":"BAR_P02","eventDesc":"Purge patient accounts","description":"Generally, the elimination of all billing/accounts receivable records will be an internal function controlled, for example, by the patient accounting or financial system. However, on occasion, there will be a need to correct an account, or a series of accounts, that may require that a notice of account deletion be sent from another sub-system and processed, for example, by the patient accounting or financial system. Although a series of accounts may be purged within this one event, we recommend that only one PID segment be sent per event.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_06"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","segmentId":null,"longName":"Message Header","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"SFT","segmentId":null,"longName":"Software Segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"2","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"UAC","segmentId":null,"longName":"User Authentication Credential Segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"3","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"EVN","segmentId":null,"longName":"Event Type","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"4","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"segmentId":null,"longName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"R","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"PID","segmentId":null,"longName":"Patient Identification","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"5","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PD1","segmentId":null,"longName":"Patient Additional Demographic","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"6","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PV1","segmentId":null,"longName":"Patient Visit","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"7","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"DB1","segmentId":null,"longName":"Disability","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"8","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}]}
