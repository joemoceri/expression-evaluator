{"id":"OM4","segmentId":"OM4","longName":"Observations That Require Specimens","description":"This segment applies to observations/batteries that require a specimen for their performance.  When an observation or battery requires multiple specimens for their performance (e.g., creatinine clearance requires a 24-hour urine specimen and a serum specimen), multiple segments may be included, one for each specimen type.\r\n\r\nOM4 is a repeating segment.  It allows multiple specimens per Order Code and accommodates for multiple alternate specimen for each preferred specimen.  In some cases an Order Code can require multiple specimens.  In many cases there are preferred specimens and for each preferred it is possible to have one or more alternative specimens.  The alternative specimen will carry in OM4-17 the Sequence Number â€“ Test/Observation Master File (OM4-1) of the preferred specimen.","sample":"","chapters":["CH_08"],"fields":[{"id":"OM4.1","type":"Field","position":"OM4.1","name":"Sequence Number - Test/Observation Master File","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"NM","dataTypeName":"Numeric","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"OM4.2","type":"Field","position":"OM4.2","name":"Derived Specimen","length":1,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"ID","dataTypeName":"Coded Value For Hl7 Defined Tables","tableId":"0170","tableName":"Derived Specimen","description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"OM4.3","type":"Field","position":"OM4.3","name":"Container Description","length":60,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"TX","dataTypeName":"Text Data","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"OM4.4","type":"Field","position":"OM4.4","name":"Container Volume","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"NM","dataTypeName":"Numeric","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"OM4.5","type":"Field","position":"OM4.5","name":"Container Units","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","tableId":"9999","tableName":"no table for CE","description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"OM4.6","type":"Field","position":"OM4.6","name":"Specimen","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","tableId":"9999","tableName":"no table for CE","description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"OM4.7","type":"Field","position":"OM4.7","name":"Additive","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","tableId":"0371","tableName":"Additive/Preservative","description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"OM4.8","type":"Field","position":"OM4.8","name":"Preparation","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"TX","dataTypeName":"Text Data","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"OM4.9","type":"Field","position":"OM4.9","name":"Special Handling Requirements","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"TX","dataTypeName":"Text Data","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"OM4.10","type":"Field","position":"OM4.10","name":"Normal Collection Volume","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"CQ","dataTypeName":"Composite Quantity With Units","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"OM4.11","type":"Field","position":"OM4.11","name":"Minimum Collection Volume","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"CQ","dataTypeName":"Composite Quantity With Units","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"OM4.12","type":"Field","position":"OM4.12","name":"Specimen Requirements","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"TX","dataTypeName":"Text Data","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"OM4.13","type":"Field","position":"OM4.13","name":"Specimen Priorities","length":1,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","dataType":"ID","dataTypeName":"Coded Value For Hl7 Defined Tables","tableId":"0027","tableName":"Priority","description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"OM4.14","type":"Field","position":"OM4.14","name":"Specimen Retention Time","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"CQ","dataTypeName":"Composite Quantity With Units","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"OM4.15","type":"Field","position":"OM4.15","name":"Specimen Handling Code","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","tableId":"0376","tableName":"Special Handling Code","description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"OM4.16","type":"Field","position":"OM4.16","name":"Specimen Preference","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"ID","dataTypeName":"Coded Value For Hl7 Defined Tables","tableId":"0920","tableName":"Preferred Specimen/Attribute Status","description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"OM4.17","type":"Field","position":"OM4.17","name":"Preferred Specimen/Attribture Sequence ID","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"NM","dataTypeName":"Numeric","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"OM4.18","type":"Field","position":"OM4.18","name":"Taxonomic Classification Code","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null}],"sequence":null,"usage":null,"rpt":null,"isGroup":false,"segments":null}
