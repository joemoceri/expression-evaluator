{"id":"AIL","segmentId":"AIL","longName":"Appointment Information - Location Resource","description":"The AIL segment contains information about location resources (meeting rooms, operating rooms, examination rooms, or other locations) that can be scheduled.  Resources included in a transaction using this segment are assumed to be controlled by a schedule on a schedule filler application.  Resources not controlled by a schedule are not identified on a schedule request using this segment.  Location resources are identified with this specific segment because of the specific encoding of locations used by the HL7 specification.","sample":"","chapters":["CH_10"],"fields":[{"id":"AIL.1","type":"Field","position":"AIL.1","name":"Set Id - Ail","length":4,"usage":"R","rpt":"1","dataType":"SI","dataTypeName":"Sequence Id","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"AIL.2","type":"Field","position":"AIL.2","name":"Segment Action Code","length":1,"usage":"C","rpt":"1","dataType":"ID","dataTypeName":"Coded Value For Hl7 Defined Tables","tableId":"0206","tableName":"Segment action code","description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"AIL.3","type":"Field","position":"AIL.3","name":"Location Resource Id","length":0,"usage":"C","rpt":"*","dataType":"PL","dataTypeName":"Person Location","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"AIL.4","type":"Field","position":"AIL.4","name":"Location Type - Ail","length":0,"usage":"C","rpt":"1","dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","tableId":"0305","tableName":"Person Location Type","description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"AIL.5","type":"Field","position":"AIL.5","name":"Location Group","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"AIL.6","type":"Field","position":"AIL.6","name":"Start Date/Time","length":0,"usage":"C","rpt":"1","dataType":"DTM","dataTypeName":"Date/time","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"AIL.7","type":"Field","position":"AIL.7","name":"Start Date/Time Offset","length":0,"usage":"C","rpt":"1","dataType":"NM","dataTypeName":"Numeric","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"AIL.8","type":"Field","position":"AIL.8","name":"Start Date/Time Offset Units","length":0,"usage":"C","rpt":"1","dataType":"CNE","dataTypeName":"Coded With No Exceptions","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"AIL.9","type":"Field","position":"AIL.9","name":"Duration","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"NM","dataTypeName":"Numeric","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"AIL.10","type":"Field","position":"AIL.10","name":"Duration Units","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"CNE","dataTypeName":"Coded With No Exceptions","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"AIL.11","type":"Field","position":"AIL.11","name":"Allow Substitution Code","length":0,"usage":"C","rpt":"1","dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","tableId":"0279","tableName":"Allow Substitution Codes","description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"AIL.12","type":"Field","position":"AIL.12","name":"Filler Status Code","length":0,"usage":"C","rpt":"1","dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","tableId":"0278","tableName":"Filler status codes","description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null}],"sequence":null,"usage":null,"rpt":null,"isGroup":false,"segments":null}
