{"id":"RXO","segmentId":"RXO","longName":"Pharmacy prescription order segment","description":"This is the “master” pharmacy/treatment order segment.  It contains order data not specific to components or additives.  Unlike the OBR, it does not contain status fields or other data that are results-only.\r\n\r\nIt can be used for any type of pharmacy order, including inpatient (unit dose and compound unit dose), outpatient, IVs, and hyperalimentation IVs (nutritional IVs), as well as other nonpharmacy treatments, e.g., respiratory therapy, oxygen, and metabolites.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to the pharmaceutical information, this segment contains additional data such as provider and text comments. \r\n\r\nA quantity/timing field is not needed in the RXO segment.  The ORC segment contains the requested ORC7-quantity/timing of the original order which does not change as the order is encoded, dispensed, or administered.
