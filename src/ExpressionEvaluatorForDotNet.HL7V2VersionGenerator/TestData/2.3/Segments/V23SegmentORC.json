{"id":"ORC","segmentId":"ORC","longName":"Common order segment","description":"The Common Order segment (ORC) is used to transmit fields that are common to all orders (all types of services that are requested).  The ORC segment is required in the Order (ORM) message.  ORC is mandatory in Order Acknowledgment (ORR) messages if an order detail segment is present, but is not required otherwise.\r\n\r\nIf details are needed for a particular type of order segment (e.g., Pharmacy, Dietary), the ORC must precede any order detail segment (e.g., RXO, ODS).  In some cases, the ORC may be as simple as the string ORC|OK|<placer order number>|<filler order number>|<cr>. \r\n\r\nIf details are not needed for the order, the order detail segment may be omitted.  For example, to place an order on hold, one would transmit an ORC with the following fields completed: ORC-1-order control with a value of HD, ORC-2-placer order number, and ORC-3-filler order
