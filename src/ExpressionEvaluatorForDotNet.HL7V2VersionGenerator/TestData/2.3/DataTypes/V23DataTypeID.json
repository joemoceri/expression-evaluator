There shall be an HL7 table number associated with ID data types. Examples of ID fields include MSH-12-version ID and OBR-25-result status. This data type should be used only for HL7 tables (see Section 2.6.7, ID number). The reverse is not true, since in some circumstances it is more appropriate to use the CE data type for HL7 tables.","dataType":null,"dataTypeName":null,"length":0,"usage":null,"rpt":null,"tableId":null,"tableName":null,"sample":"","fields":[]}
