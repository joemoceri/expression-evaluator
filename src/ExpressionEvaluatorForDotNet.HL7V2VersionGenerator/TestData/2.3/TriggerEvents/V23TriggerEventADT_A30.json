{"id":"ADT_A30","msgStructId":"ADT_A30","eventDesc":"Merge person information","description":"An A30 event can be used to merge person information on an MPI.  The A34 (merge patient information-patient ID only), A35 (merge patient information-account number only), A36 (merge patient information-patient ID & account number), A40 (merge patient-internal ID), A41(merge account-patient account number) and A42 (merge visit-visit number)events should be used to merge patient information for a current episode.  The “incorrect MRN” identified on the MRG segment (MRG-1-prior patient ID-internal) is to be merged with the “correct MRN” identified on the PID segment (PID-3-patient ID (internal ID)).  The “incorrect MRN” then no longer exists.  All PID data associated with the “correct MRN” are treated as updated information.\r\n\r\nAn A30 (merge person information) is intended for merging person records without merging patient identifiers.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_03"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","segmentId":null,"longName":"Message header segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"EVN","segmentId":null,"longName":"Event type","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"2","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PID","segmentId":null,"longName":"Patient Identification","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"3","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PD1","segmentId":null,"longName":"Patient Demographic","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"4","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"MRG","segmentId":null,"longName":"Merge patient information","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"5","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}
