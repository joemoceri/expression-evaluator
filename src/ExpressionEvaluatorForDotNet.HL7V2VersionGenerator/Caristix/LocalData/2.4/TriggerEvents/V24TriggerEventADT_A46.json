The \"incorrect source patient ID\" value is stored in the MRG segment (MRG-4 - prior patient ID) and is to be changed to the \"correct target patient ID\" value stored in the PID segment (PID-2 - patient ID).\r\n\r\nEvent A46 has been retained for backward compatibility only, corresponding with PID-2 - patient ID, which is also retained for backward compatibility. From V2.3.1 onwards, event A47 (change patient identifier list) should be used instead. A change has been done at the patient identifier level.  That is, a PID-2 - patient ID has been found to be incorrect and has been changed.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_03"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","segmentId":null,"longName":"Message Header","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"EVN","segmentId":null,"longName":"Event Type","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"2","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PID","segmentId":null,"longName":"Patient identification","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"3","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PD1","segmentId":null,"longName":"Patient Additional Demographic","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"4","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"MRG","segmentId":null,"longName":"Merge patient information","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"5","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}
