{"id":"ADT_A30","msgStructId":"ADT_A30","eventDesc":"Merge person information","description":"An A30 (merge person information) is intended for merging person records without merging patient identifiers.\r\n\r\nEvent A30 has been retained for backward compatibility only.  An A30 event was used to merge person information on an MPI.  From V 2.3.1 onwards, the A40 (merge patient-patient identifier list) events should be used to merge patient information for a current episode.  The \"incorrect MRN\" identified on the MRG segment (MRG-1 - prior patient identifier list) is to be merged with the \"correct MRN\" identified on the PID segment (PID-3 - patient identifier list).  The \"incorrect MRN\" then no longer exists.  All PID data associated with the \"correct MRN\" are treated as updated information.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_03"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","segmentId":null,"longName":"Message Header","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"EVN","segmentId":null,"longName":"Event Type","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"2","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PID","segmentId":null,"longName":"Patient identification","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"3","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PD1","segmentId":null,"longName":"Patient Additional Demographic","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"4","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"MRG","segmentId":null,"longName":"Merge patient information","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"5","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}
