For example, a complete battery or an entire radiology report might be thought of as comprising a logical group, though it might have as few as six or as many as 120 lines.  Knowledge of the logical break points in the display data can be useful to the application system that is displaying or printing data.  For this reason, DSP-4-Logical break point is used.  The sending application (the one that formats the data) places the logical break points where appropriate.  If there is a particular ancillary result ID associated with the data delineated by DSP-4-Logical break point, the value of this ID also can be returned in DSP-5-Result ID.  Then if the user selects the area of the display delineated by DSP-4-Logical break point, the displaying system can query for the associated DSP-5-Result ID.","sample":"","fields":[]},{"id":"DSP.5","type":"Field","position":"DSP.5","name":"Result Id","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"TX","dataTypeName":"Text Data","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":"When the user selects a result ID (defined by DSP-4-Logical break point) from the screen display corresponding to a record in which DSP-5-Result ID is non-null, the application can initiate a second query (a separate session) to the ancillary with the QRD-10-What department data code filled in with this non-null value (e.g., the ancillary accession number or its equivalent).  The ancillary response will contain the report referenced by this result ID (e.g., accession number).  The ancillary should correlate the result ID with DSP-4-Logical break point as follows: If more than one line of text is sent per result, DSP-5-Result ID should be only non-null for a DSP segment that contains a non-null DSP-4-Logical break point.  This field may be broken into components by local agreement.  A common example might be to include placer order number, filler order number, and universal service identifier.  Whenever such fields are used as components of the result ID, their components will be sent as subcomponents.","sample":"","fields":[]}]}
