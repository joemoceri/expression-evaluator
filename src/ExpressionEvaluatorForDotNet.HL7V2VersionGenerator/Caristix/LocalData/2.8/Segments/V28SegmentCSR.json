{"id":"CSR","segmentId":"CSR","longName":"Clinical Study Registration","description":"The CSR segment will contain fundamental administrative and regulatory information required to document a patientâ€™s enrollment on a clinical trial. This segment is all that is required if one needs to message another system that an enrollment has taken place, i.e., from clinical trials to pharmacy, accounting, or order entry systems. The CSR segment may also be used to identify that OBR, OBX, RXA, and RXR segments that follow represent data applicable to the identified study.","sample":"","chapters":["CH_07"],"fields":[{"id":"CSR.1","type":"Field","position":"CSR.1","name":"Sponsor Study Id","length":0,"usage":"R","rpt":"1","dataType":"EI","dataTypeName":"Entity Identifier","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"CSR.2","type":"Field","position":"CSR.2","name":"Alternate Study Id","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"EI","dataTypeName":"Entity Identifier","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"CSR.3","type":"Field","position":"CSR.3","name":"Institution Registering The Patient","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","tableId":"9999","tableName":"no table for CE","description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"CSR.4","type":"Field","position":"CSR.4","name":"Sponsor Patient Id","length":0,"usage":"R","rpt":"1","dataType":"CX","dataTypeName":"Extended Composite Id With Check Digit","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"CSR.5","type":"Field","position":"CSR.5","name":"Alternate Patient Id - Csr","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"CX","dataTypeName":"Extended Composite Id With Check Digit","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"CSR.6","type":"Field","position":"CSR.6","name":"Date/Time Of Patient Study Registration","length":0,"usage":"R","rpt":"1","dataType":"DTM","dataTypeName":"Date/time","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"CSR.7","type":"Field","position":"CSR.7","name":"Person Performing Study Registration","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","dataType":"XCN","dataTypeName":"Extended Composite Id Number And Name For Persons","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"CSR.8","type":"Field","position":"CSR.8","name":"Study Authorizing Provider","length":0,"usage":"R","rpt":"*","dataType":"XCN","dataTypeName":"Extended Composite Id Number And Name For Persons","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"CSR.9","type":"Field","position":"CSR.9","name":"Date/Time Patient Study Consent Signed","length":0,"usage":"C","rpt":"1","dataType":"DTM","dataTypeName":"Date/time","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"CSR.10","type":"Field","position":"CSR.10","name":"Patient Study Eligibility Status","length":0,"usage":"C","rpt":"1","dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","tableId":"9999","tableName":"no table for CE","description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"CSR.11","type":"Field","position":"CSR.11","name":"Study Randomization Date/Time","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"3","dataType":"DTM","dataTypeName":"Date/time","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"CSR.12","type":"Field","position":"CSR.12","name":"Randomized Study Arm","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"3","dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","tableId":"9999","tableName":"no table for CE","description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"CSR.13","type":"Field","position":"CSR.13","name":"Stratum For Study Randomization","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"3","dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","tableId":"9999","tableName":"no table for CE","description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"CSR.14","type":"Field","position":"CSR.14","name":"Patient Evaluability Status","length":0,"usage":"C","rpt":"1","dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","tableId":"9999","tableName":"no table for CE","description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"CSR.15","type":"Field","position":"CSR.15","name":"Date/Time Ended Study","length":0,"usage":"C","rpt":"1","dataType":"DTM","dataTypeName":"Date/time","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"CSR.16","type":"Field","position":"CSR.16","name":"Reason Ended Study","length":0,"usage":"C","rpt":"1","dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","tableId":"9999","tableName":"no table for CE","description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null}],"sequence":null,"usage":null,"rpt":null,"isGroup":false,"segments":null}
