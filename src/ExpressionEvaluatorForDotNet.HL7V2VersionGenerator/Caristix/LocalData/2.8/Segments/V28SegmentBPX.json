This segment is similar to an OBX segment, but contains additional attributes.\r\n\r\nThe BP prefix in the element name indicates that the attribute pertains to any type of blood product.

A blood component is defined as the whole or any part of a blood donation. For example, from one whole blood donation, the unit of whole blood can be fractionated into red blood cells, plasma and platelets with each component contained in separate bags. These types of blood products are assigned a unique donation identification number as well as a product code that indicates the type of component contained in the bag.\r\n\r\nThe CP prefix in the element name indicates that the attribute pertains only to Commercial Products.
