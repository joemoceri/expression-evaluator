{"id":"EHC_E12","msgStructId":"EHC_E12","eventDesc":"Request Additional Information","description":"A Payer or TPA uses this message to request additional information in support of an Invoice or a (Pre) Authorization Request.  Normally, this request would be sent following receipt of an E01 or E20 message.  However, it can also be sent following receipt of an E04 Re-Assess HealthCare Services Invoice Request.  In this latter case the request for additional information still has as its object the original invoice (which is now under review) rather than the Re-assessment request per se.\r\n\r\nThe E12 can only be used to initiate a request for information and cannot be used to modify, place on hold or cancel an earlier request.  This message cannot be used to convey information on the status of a claim and/or adjudication results (i.e., cannot be used in place of an E10 Edit/Adjudication Results message).\r\n\r\nThe scope of the request for additional information is defined through the inclusion of contextual data from the original Invoice or (Pre) Authorization Request.  By specifying a particular Product/Service Group, patient and/or Product/Service Line item the requested information (e.g., a discharge narrative) is deemed to apply to those particular service events and not to any others which may have been part of the original Invoice or (Pre) Authorization Request.\r\n\r\nIn terms of absolute limits the E12 request is restricted to a single Product/Service Group from the original Invoice or (Pre) Authorization Request.   Thereafter, the context can be more narrowly defined by inclusion of patient and/or Product/Service Line item information from within the same Product/Service Group. Thus, if a particular P/S Line Item is included, the message recipient must interpret this to mean that the request is related to that one line item.  If the P/S Line Item is excluded the request is related to any and all line items in the original Product/Service Group.  Similarly for patients: identification of a particular patient restricts the request to that patient alone, whereas omission of patient information means that the request applies to any and all patients identified in the original Product/Service Group.\r\n\r\nThe E12 message is restricted to zero or one patients and to zero or one Product/Service Line items.  One consequence of these limits is that a Payer requiring information about a variety of patients or products/services from an original invoice may have to generate multiple (E12) requests. \r\n\r\nThe E12 message requires the use of LOINC classification standard to describe the information being requested (as do the E13/14 response messages).  The codified request can also be supplemented by free-form text if greater specificity is required.\r\n\r\nThis message supports the use of pre-defined responses.  That is, the sender specifies both the request as well as a range of possible answers for the recipient to choose from.  This is an optional usage that is designed for real-time environments in which the Payer employs an adjudication engine to both solicit the additional information and manage the responses.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_16"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","segmentId":"MSH","longName":"Message Header","description":"The MSH segment defines the intent, source, destination, and some specifics of the syntax of a message.","sample":"","chapters":["CH_02"],"fields":[{"id":"MSH.1","type":"Field","position":"MSH.1","name":"Field Separator","length":1,"usage":"R","rpt":"1","dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":"This field contains the separator between the segment ID and the first real field, MSH-2 Encoding Characters.

Refer to HL7 Table 0211 - Alternate Character Sets for valid values.\r\n\r\nAn HL7 message uses field MSH-18 Character Set to specify the character set(s) in use. Valid values for this field are specified in HL7 Table 0211 - Alternate Character Sets. MSH-18 Character Set may be left blank, or may contain one or more values delimited by the repetition separator. If the field is left blank, the character set in use is understood to be the 7-bit ASCII set, decimal 0 through decimal 127 (hex 00 through hex 7F). This default value may also be explicitly specified as ASCII.\r\n\r\nMore than one character set may be used in a message. The first occurrence, if supplied, of the MSH-18 must indicate the default encoding of the message. The second and subsequent occurrences of MSH-18-character set are used to specify additional character sets that are used.\r\nThe repetitions of this field to specify different character sets apply only to fields of the FT, ST and TX data types. See also section 2.7.2, \"Escape sequences supporting multiple character sets\".\r\n\r\nAny encoding system, single-byte or multi-byte, may be specified as the default character encoding in MSH-18 Character Set. If the default encoding is other than 7-bit ASCII, sites shall document this usage in the dynamic conformance profile or other implementation agreement. This is particularly effective in promoting interoperability between nations belonging to different HL7 Affiliates, while limiting the amount of testing required to determine the encoding of a message.\r\n\r\nBy using built-in language functions for string and character manipulation, parsers and applications need not be concerned whether a single or double byte character set is in use, provided it is applied to the entire message. Using a built in function to extract the fourth CHARACTER will always yield the field separator character, regardless of coding set. On the other hand, if the parser looks at the fourth BYTE, it is then limited to single byte character sets, since the fourth byte would contain the low order 8 bits of the character S in a double-byte system.\r\n\r\nNote: When describing encoding rules, this standard always speaks in terms of character position, not byte offset. Similarly, comparisons should be done on character values, not their byte equivalents. For this reason, delimiter characters should always have representation in the standard 7-bit ASCII character set, regardless of the actual character set being used, so that a search for the character CR (carriage return) can be performed.\r\n   a) if the field is not valued, the default single-byte character set (ASCII (\"ISO IR6\")) should be assumed.

A given institution, or group of intercommunicating institutions, should establish a list of assigning authorities that may be potential assignors of patient identification (and other important identification) numbers.  The list will be one of the institution's master dictionary lists.  Since third parties (other than the assignors of patient identification numbers) may send or receive HL7 messages containing patient identification numbers, the assigning authority in the patient identification numbers may not be the same as the sending and receiving systems identified in the MSH.  The assigning authority must be unique across applications at a given site.  This field is required in HL7 implementations that have more than a single Patient Administration application assigning such numbers. The assigning authority and identifier type codes are strongly recommended for all CX data types.\r\n\r\nWith HL7 V2.3, the nomenclature for the fourth component of the patient identifiers was changed from \"assigning facility ID\" to \"assigning authority\".  While the identifier may be unique to a given healthcare facility (for example, a medical record assigned by facility A in Hospital XYZ), the identifier might also be assigned at a system level (for example a corporate person index or enterprise number spanning multiple facilities) or by a government entity, for example a nationally assigned unique individual identifier.  While a facility is usually an assigning authority, not all assigning authorities are facilities.  Therefore, the fourth component is referred to as an assigning authority, but retains backward compatibility using the construct of the HD data type (see the note in chapter 2).  Additionally, CX data types support the use of assigning facility (HD) as the sixth component.","sample":"","chapters":["CH_03"],"fields":[{"id":"PID.1","type":"Field","position":"PID.1","name":"Set Id - Pid","length":4,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"SI","dataTypeName":"Sequence Id","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":"This field contains the number that identifies this transaction.
