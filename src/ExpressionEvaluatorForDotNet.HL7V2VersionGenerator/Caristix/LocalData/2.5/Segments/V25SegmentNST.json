{"id":"NST","segmentId":"NST","longName":"Application control level statistics","description":"The NST segment allows application control-level statistical information to be passed between the various systems on the network. Some fields in this segment refer to portions of lower level protocols; they contain information that can be used by application management applications monitoring the state of various network links.\r\n\r\nUsage Notes: Fields 2-15.  These are all marked optional since the statistics kept on a particular link and negotiated between the two systems in question will vary.  Not all values will apply to each system.  Some values are concerned with the type of port, and some values pertain to the lower level protocol.","sample":"","chapters":["CH_14"],"fields":[{"id":"NST.1","type":"Field","position":"NST.1","name":"Statistics Available","length":1,"usage":"R","rpt":"1","dataType":"ID","dataTypeName":"Coded values for HL7 tables","tableId":"0136","tableName":"Yes/no indicator","description":"This field indicates the availability of statistics.
