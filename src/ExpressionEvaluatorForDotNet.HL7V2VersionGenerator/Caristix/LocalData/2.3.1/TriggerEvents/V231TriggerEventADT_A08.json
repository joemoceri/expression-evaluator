{"id":"ADT_A08","msgStructId":"ADT_A08","eventDesc":"Update patient information","description":"This trigger event is used when any patient information has changed but when no other trigger event has occurred.  For example, an A08 event can be used to notify the receiving systems of a change of address or a name change.  We recommend that the A08 transaction be used to update fields that are not related to any of the other trigger events.  The A08 event can include information specific to an episode of care, but it can also be used for demographic information only.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_03"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","segmentId":null,"longName":"Message header segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"EVN","segmentId":null,"longName":"Event type segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"2","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PID","segmentId":null,"longName":"Patient identification segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"3","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PD1","segmentId":null,"longName":"Patient Additional Demographic","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"4","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NK1","segmentId":null,"longName":"Next of kin / associated parties segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"5","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PV1","segmentId":null,"longName":"Patient visit segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"6","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PV2","segmentId":null,"longName":"Patient visit - additional information segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"7","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"DB1","segmentId":null,"longName":"Disability segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"8","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"OBX","segmentId":null,"longName":"Observation/result segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"9","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"AL1","segmentId":null,"longName":"Patient allergy information segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"10","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"DG1","segmentId":null,"longName":"Diagnosis segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"11","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"DRG","segmentId":null,"longName":"Diagnosis related group segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"12","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"segmentId":null,"longName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"PR1","segmentId":null,"longName":"Procedures segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"13","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"ROL","segmentId":null,"longName":"Role","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"14","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":"GT1","segmentId":null,"longName":"Guarantor segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"15","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"segmentId":null,"longName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"IN1","segmentId":null,"longName":"Insurance segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"16","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"IN2","segmentId":null,"longName":"Insurance additional information segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"17","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"IN3","segmentId":null,"longName":"Insurance additional information, certification segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"18","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":"ACC","segmentId":null,"longName":"Accident segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"19","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"UB1","segmentId":null,"longName":"UB82 data segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"20","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"UB2","segmentId":null,"longName":"UB92 data segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"21","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}
