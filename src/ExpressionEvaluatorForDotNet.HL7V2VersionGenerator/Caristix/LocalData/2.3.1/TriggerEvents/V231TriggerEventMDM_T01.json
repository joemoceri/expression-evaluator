There are multiple approaches by which systems become aware of documents:\r\n\r\nScenario A: A document is dictated and chart tracking system is notified that it has been dictated and is awaiting transcription.\r\n\r\nScenario B: Dictation is transcribed and chart tracking system is notified that the document exists and requires authentication.\r\n\r\nScenario C: A provider orders a series of three X-rays.  The radiologist dictates a single document which covers all three orders.  Multiple placer numbers are used to identify each of these orders.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_09"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","segmentId":null,"longName":"Message header segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"EVN","segmentId":null,"longName":"Event type segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"2","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PID","segmentId":null,"longName":"Patient identification segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"3","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PV1","segmentId":null,"longName":"Patient visit segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"4","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"TXA","segmentId":null,"longName":"Document notification segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"5","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}
