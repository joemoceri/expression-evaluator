{"id":"CM_OSD","type":"DataType","name":"Order Sequence","description":"There are many situations, such as the creation of an order for a group of intravenous (IV) solutions, where the sequence of the individual intravenous solutions (each a service in itself) needs to be specified, e.g., hyperalimentation with multi-vitamins in every third bottle.\r\n\r\nThere are other situations where part of the order’s instructions contains a results condition of some type, such as “PRN pain.”  There is currently a free text “condition” component of ORC-7-quantity/timing which allows any condition to be specified.  However, to support a fully encoded version of order sequencing, or results condition, we have defined in the following paragraphs a 10th component of ORC-7quantity/timing.\r\n\r\nThe sequencing conditions supported by this 10th component are based on the completion of a  predecessor service.","dataType":null,"dataTypeName":null,"length":0,"usage":null,"rpt":null,"tableId":null,"tableName":null,"sample":"","fields":[{"id":"CM_OSD.1","type":"DataTypeComponent","position":"CM_OSD.1","name":"Sequence/results Flag","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"ID","dataTypeName":"Coded values for HL7 tables","tableId":"OSD1","tableName":"Sequence condition","description":"S for sequence conditions; C for cyclical; R is reserved for possible future use.
