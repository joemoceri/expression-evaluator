{"id":"ADT_A03","msgStructId":"ADT_A03","eventDesc":"Discharge/end visit","description":"An A03 event signals the end of a patient’s stay in a healthcare facility. It signals that the patient’s status has changed to “discharged” and that a discharge date has been recorded. The patient is no longer in the facility. The patient’s location prior to discharge should be entered in PV1-3-assigned patient location.\r\n\r\nAn A03 event can be sent to notify:  the pharmacy that the patient’s stay has ended and that entitlement to drugs has changed accordingly; the nursing system that the patient has been discharged and that the care plan can be completed; the finance system that the patient billing period has ended; and/or the clinical repository that discharge has taken place for the EMR.\r\n\r\nFor non-admitted patients, an A03 event signals the end of a patient’s visit to a healthcare facility. It could be used to signal the end of a visit for a one-time or recurring outpatient who is not assigned to a bed. It could also be used to signal the end of a visit to the Emergency Room.  PV1-45-discharge date/time can be used for the visit end date/time.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_03"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","segmentId":null,"longName":"Message header segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"EVN","segmentId":null,"longName":"Event type","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"2","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PID","segmentId":null,"longName":"Patient Identification","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"3","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PD1","segmentId":null,"longName":"Patient Demographic","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"4","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PV1","segmentId":null,"longName":"Patient visit","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"5","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PV2","segmentId":null,"longName":"Patient visit - additional information","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"6","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"DB1","segmentId":null,"longName":"Disability Segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"7","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"DG1","segmentId":null,"longName":"Diagnosis","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"8","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"DRG","segmentId":null,"longName":"Diagnosis Related Group","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"9","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"segmentId":null,"longName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"PR1","segmentId":null,"longName":"Procedures","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"10","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"ROL","segmentId":null,"longName":"Role","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"11","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":"OBX","segmentId":null,"longName":"Observation segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"12","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}
