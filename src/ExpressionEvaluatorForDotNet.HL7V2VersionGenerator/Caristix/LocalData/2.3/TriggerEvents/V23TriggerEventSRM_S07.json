After the request has been assigned to one or more slots, however, the filler application should assign a unique filler appointment ID (see Sections 10.5.1.1, “Placer appointment ID  (EI)   00860,” and 10.5.1.2, “Filler appointment ID  (EI)   00861 ).”  This filler appointment ID, as its definition indicates, should uniquely identify the appointment among all such requests and appointments within the filler application.  This means that, once assigned, the filler appointment ID should uniquely identify the appointment (either as a request or as a booked appointment) without a need to provide the schedule ID too.  As a cautionary note regarding implementation, if the filler appointment ID would not otherwise be unique, it may be necessary to include the schedule ID as part of the filler appointment ID.
