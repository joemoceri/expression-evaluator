When the value type is TX or FT then the results are bulk text.  The valid values for the value type of an observation are listed in HL7 table 0125 - Value type. \r\n\r\nThe observation value must be represented according to the format for the data type defined in Chapter 2, Section 2.8, “Data Types.”  For example, a PN consists of 6 components, separated by component delimiters.  \r\n\r\nAlthough NM is a valid type, observations which are usually reported as numbers will sometimes have the string (ST) data type because non-numeric characters are often reported as part of the result, e.g., >300 to indicate the result was off-scale for the instrument.  In the example, \">300\", \">\" is a symbol and the digits are considered a numeric value.  However, this usage of the ST type should be discouraged since the SN (structured numeric) data type now accommodates such reporting and, in addition, permits the receiving system to interpret the magnitude. \r\n\r\nAll HL7 data types are valid, and are included in Table 0125 except CM, CQ, SI, and ID.  For a CM definition to have meaning, the specifics about the CM must be included in the field definition.  OBX-5-observation value is a general field definition that is influenced by the data type OBX-3, so CMs are undefined in this context.   CQ is invalid because units for OBX-5-observation value are always specified explicitly in an OBX segment with OBX-6 units.  SI is invalid because it only applied to HL7 message segments, and ID because it requires a constant field definition. \r\n\r\nThe RP value (reference pointer) must be used if the actual observation value is not sent in OBX but exists somewhere else.  For example, if the observation consists of an image (document or medical), the image itself cannot be sent in OBX.  The sending system may in that case opt to send a reference pointer.

A set of message segments for transmitting such master observation tables is described in Chapter 8.  The relation of an observation ID to a master observation table is analogous to the relationship between a charge code (in a billing record) and the charge master. \r\n\r\nWhen local codes are used as the first identifier in this field we strongly encourage sending a universal identifier as well to permit receivers to equivalence results from different providers of the same service (e.g., a hospital lab and commercial lab that provides serum potassium to a nursing home).
