{"id":"CSR","segmentId":"CSR","longName":"Clinical Study Registration","description":"The CSR segment will contain fundamental administrative and regulatory information required to document a patients enrollment on a clinical trial. This segment is all that is required if one needs to message another system that an enrollment has taken place, i.e., from clinical trials to pharmacy, accounting, or order entry systems. The CSR segment may also be used to identify that OBR, OBX, RXA, and RXR segments that follow represent data applicable to the identified study.","sample":"","chapters":["CH_07"],"fields":[{"id":"CSR.1","type":"Field","position":"CSR.1","name":"Sponsor Study ID","length":60,"usage":"R","rpt":"1","dataType":"EI","dataTypeName":"Entity Identifier","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"CSR.2","type":"Field","position":"CSR.2","name":"Alternate Study ID","length":60,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"EI","dataTypeName":"Entity Identifier","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"CSR.3","type":"Field","position":"CSR.3","name":"Institution Registering the Patient","length":250,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"CE","dataTypeName":"Coded Element","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"CSR.4","type":"Field","position":"CSR.4","name":"Sponsor Patient ID","length":30,"usage":"R","rpt":"1","dataType":"CX","dataTypeName":"Extended Composite ID with Check Digit","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"CSR.5","type":"Field","position":"CSR.5","name":"Alternate Patient ID - CSR","length":30,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"CX","dataTypeName":"Extended Composite ID with Check Digit","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"CSR.6","type":"Field","position":"CSR.6","name":"Date/Time Of Patient Study Registration","length":26,"usage":"R","rpt":"1","dataType":"TS","dataTypeName":"Time Stamp","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"CSR.7","type":"Field","position":"CSR.7","name":"Person Performing Study Registration","length":250,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","dataType":"XCN","dataTypeName":"Extended Composite ID Number and Name for Persons","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"CSR.8","type":"Field","position":"CSR.8","name":"Study Authorizing Provider","length":250,"usage":"R","rpt":"*","dataType":"XCN","dataTypeName":"Extended Composite ID Number and Name for Persons","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"CSR.9","type":"Field","position":"CSR.9","name":"Date/time Patient Study Consent Signed","length":26,"usage":"C","rpt":"1","dataType":"TS","dataTypeName":"Time Stamp","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"CSR.10","type":"Field","position":"CSR.10","name":"Patient Study Eligibility Status","length":250,"usage":"C","rpt":"1","dataType":"CE","dataTypeName":"Coded Element","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"CSR.11","type":"Field","position":"CSR.11","name":"Study Randomization Date/time","length":26,"usage":"O","rpt":"3","dataType":"TS","dataTypeName":"Time Stamp","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"CSR.12","type":"Field","position":"CSR.12","name":"Randomized Study Arm","length":250,"usage":"O","rpt":"3","dataType":"CE","dataTypeName":"Coded Element","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"CSR.13","type":"Field","position":"CSR.13","name":"Stratum for Study Randomization","length":250,"usage":"O","rpt":"3","dataType":"CE","dataTypeName":"Coded Element","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"CSR.14","type":"Field","position":"CSR.14","name":"Patient Evaluability Status","length":250,"usage":"C","rpt":"1","dataType":"CE","dataTypeName":"Coded Element","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"CSR.15","type":"Field","position":"CSR.15","name":"Date/time Ended Study","length":26,"usage":"C","rpt":"1","dataType":"TS","dataTypeName":"Time Stamp","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"CSR.16","type":"Field","position":"CSR.16","name":"Reason Ended Study","length":250,"usage":"C","rpt":"1","dataType":"CE","dataTypeName":"Coded Element","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null}],"sequence":null,"usage":null,"rpt":null,"isGroup":false,"segments":null}
