{"id":"DG1","segmentId":"DG1","longName":"Diagnosis","description":"The DG1 segment contains patient diagnosis information of various types, for example, admitting, primary, etc. The DG1 segment is used to send multiple diagnoses (for example, for medical records encoding). It is also used when the FT1-19 - Diagnosis Code - FT1 does not provide sufficient information for a billing system. This diagnosis coding should be distinguished from the clinical problem segment used by caregivers to manage the patient (see Chapter 12, Patient Care). Coding methodologies are also defined.","sample":"","chapters":["CH_06"],"fields":[{"id":"DG1.1","type":"Field","position":"DG1.1","name":"Set ID - DG1","length":4,"usage":"R","rpt":"1","dataType":"SI","dataTypeName":"Sequence ID","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"DG1.2","type":"Field","position":"DG1.2","name":"Diagnosis Coding Method","length":2,"usage":"B","rpt":"1","dataType":"ID","dataTypeName":"Coded values for HL7 tables","tableId":"0053","tableName":"Diagnosis Coding Method","description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"DG1.3","type":"Field","position":"DG1.3","name":"Diagnosis Code -
