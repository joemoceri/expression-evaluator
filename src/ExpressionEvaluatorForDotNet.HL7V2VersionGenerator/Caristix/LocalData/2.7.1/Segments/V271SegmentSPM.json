{"id":"SPM","segmentId":"SPM","longName":"Specimen","description":"The intent of this segment is to describe the characteristics of a specimen. It differs from the intent of the OBR in that the OBR addresses order-specific information. It differs from the SAC segment in that the SAC addresses specimen container attributes. An advantage afforded by a separate specimen segment is that it generalizes the multiple relationships among order(s), results, specimen(s) and specimen container(s).\r\n\r\nA specimen is defined as \"A physical entity that is an individual, a group, an item, or a part representative of a larger group, class or whole that is the target of an observation or analysis for the purpose of drawing conclusions about the group, class, or whole.\" Note that any physical entity in the universe has the potential to become a specimen\r\n\r\nA specimen is collected or obtained from a source and may be representative of the source, or may represent a deviation within the source. A specimen may be wholly or partially consumed during an observation and any remaining portion of the specimen is persistent and can be stored.\r\n\r\nThis segment may also be used in limited cases to describe a \"virtual\" specimen. In particular, to identify the characteristics required for a specimen in the context of a specific observation or test.\r\n\r\nIn summary, SPM represents the attributes specific and unique to a specimen.","sample":"","chapters":["CH_07"],"fields":[{"id":"SPM.1","type":"Field","position":"SPM.1","name":"Set Id - Spm","length":4,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"SI","dataTypeName":"Sequence
