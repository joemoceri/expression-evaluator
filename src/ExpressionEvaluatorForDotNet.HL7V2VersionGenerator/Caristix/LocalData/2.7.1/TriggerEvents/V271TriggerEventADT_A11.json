Refer to HL7 Table 0211 - Alternate Character Sets for valid values.\r\n\r\nAn HL7 message uses field MSH-18 Character Set to specify the character set(s) in use. Valid values for this field are specified in HL7 Table 0211 - Alternate Character Sets. MSH-18 Character Set may be left blank, or may contain one or more values delimited by the repetition separator. If the field is left blank, the character set in use is understood to be the 7-bit ASCII set, decimal 0 through decimal 127 (hex 00 through hex 7F). This default value may also be explicitly specified as ASCII.\r\n\r\nMore than one character set may be used in a message. The first occurrence, if supplied, of the MSH-18 must indicate the default encoding of the message. The second and subsequent occurrences of MSH-18-character set are used to specify additional character sets that are used.\r\nThe repetitions of this field to specify different character sets apply only to fields of the FT, ST and TX data types. See also section 2.7.2, \"Escape sequences supporting multiple character sets\".\r\n\r\nAny encoding system, single-byte or multi-byte, may be specified as the default character encoding in MSH-18 Character Set. If the default encoding is other than 7-bit ASCII, sites shall document this usage in the dynamic conformance profile or other implementation agreement. This is particularly effective in promoting interoperability between nations belonging to different HL7 Affiliates, while limiting the amount of testing required to determine the encoding of a message.\r\n\r\nBy using built-in language functions for string and character manipulation, parsers and applications need not be concerned whether a single or double byte character set is in use, provided it is applied to the entire message. Using a built in function to extract the fourth CHARACTER will always yield the field separator character, regardless of coding set. On the other hand, if the parser looks at the fourth BYTE, it is then limited to single byte character sets, since the fourth byte would contain the low order 8 bits of the character S in a double-byte system.\r\n\r\nNote: When describing encoding rules, this standard always speaks in terms of character position, not byte offset. Similarly, comparisons should be done on character values, not their byte equivalents. For this reason, delimiter characters should always have representation in the standard 7-bit ASCII character set, regardless of the actual character set being used, so that a search for the character CR (carriage return) can be performed.\r\n   a) if the field is not valued, the default single-byte character set (ASCII (\"ISO IR6\")) should be assumed. No other character sets are allowed in the message.\r\n   b) if the field repeats, but the first element is NULL (i.e., present but unvalued), the single-byte ASCII (\"ISO IR6\") is assumed as the default character set.\r\n   c) elements in the remainder of the sequence (i.e., elements 2..n) are alternate character sets that may be used.","sample":"","fields":[]},{"id":"MSH.19","type":"Field","position":"MSH.19","name":"Principal Language Of Message","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":"This field contains the principal language of the message.

This segment contains permanent patient identifying and demographic information that, for the most part, is not likely to change frequently.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that from V2.4 onwards the demographics of animals can also be sent in the PID segment (see PID-35 to PID-38).\r\n\r\nThe assigning authority, the fourth component of the patient identifiers, is a HD data type that is uniquely associated with the assigning authority that originally assigned the number.  A given institution, or group of intercommunicating institutions, should establish a list of assigning authorities that may be potential assignors of patient identification (and other important identification) numbers.  The list will be one of the institution's master dictionary lists.  Since third parties (other than the assignors of patient identification numbers) may send or receive HL7 messages containing patient identification numbers, the assigning authority in the patient identification numbers may not be the same as the sending and receiving systems identified in the MSH.  The assigning authority must be unique across applications at a given site.  This field is required in HL7 implementations that have more than a single Patient Administration application assigning such numbers. The assigning authority and identifier type codes are strongly recommended for all CX data types.\r\n\r\nWith HL7 V2.3, the nomenclature for the fourth component of the patient identifiers was changed from \"assigning facility ID\" to \"assigning authority\".  While the identifier may be unique to a given healthcare facility (for example, a medical record assigned by facility A in Hospital XYZ), the identifier might also be assigned at a system level (for example a corporate person index or enterprise number spanning multiple facilities) or by a government entity, for example a nationally assigned unique individual identifier.  While a facility is usually an assigning authority, not all assigning authorities are facilities.  Therefore, the fourth component is referred to as an assigning authority, but retains backward compatibility using the construct of the HD data type (see the note in chapter 2).  Additionally, CX data types support the use of assigning facility (HD) as the sixth component.","sample":"","chapters":["CH_03"],"fields":[{"id":"PID.1","type":"Field","position":"PID.1","name":"Set Id - Pid","length":4,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"SI","dataTypeName":"Sequence Id","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":"This field contains the number that identifies this transaction.

It represents the smallest indivisible unit of a report. The OBX segment can also contain encapsulated data, e.g., a CDA document or a DICOM image.\r\n\r\nIts principal mission is to carry information about observations in report messages. But the OBX can also be part of an observation order (see Chapter 4, section 4.4, \"General Trigger Events & Message Definitions\"). In this case, the OBX carries clinical information needed by the filler to interpret the observation the filler makes. For example, an OBX is needed to report the inspired oxygen on an order for a blood oxygen to a blood gas lab, or to report the menstrual phase information which should be included on an order for a pap smear to a cytology lab. Appendix 7A includes codes for identifying many of pieces of information needed by observation producing services to properly interpret a test result. OBX is also found in other HL7 messages that need to include patient clinical information.\r\n\r\nWhen using the OBX for the TIM category, OBX-2 Value Type should be valued to DTM.

As of v2.7, the ST data type may not be used to transmit data that can be more precisely transmitted using other data types, e.g. SN when comparative symbols are needed.\r\n\r\nCQ is invalid because units for OBX-5-observation value are always specified explicitly in an OBX segment with OBX-6 units. SI is invalid because it only applies to HL7 message segments; ID is also invalid because it requires a constant field definition.\r\n\r\nThe RP value (reference pointer) must be used if the OBX-5 contains a pointer to the data e.g., a URL of an image. The receiving system can use this reference pointer whenever it needs access to the actual data through other interface standards, e.g., DICOM, or through appropriate data base servers.\r\n\r\nThe structured numeric (SN) data type provides for reporting ranges (e.g., 3-5 or 10-20), titres (e.g., 1:10), and out-of-range indicators (e.g., >50) in a structured and computer-interpretable way.\r\n\r\nWe allow the FT data type in the OBX segment, but its use is discouraged.

It is traditional for surgical pathology reports to include all the tissues taken from one surgical procedure in one report. Consider, for example, a single surgical pathology report that describes the examination of gallbladder and appendix tissue. This report would be transmitted roughly as shown here:\r\nOBR|1||1234^LAB|11529-5^Study report^LN|...<cr>\r\nOBX|1|CWE|88304&ANT|1|T57000^GALLBLADDER^SNM|...<cr>\r\nOBX|2|TX|22634-0^Path report.gross observation^LN|1|THIS IS A NORMAL GALLBLADDER|...<cr>\r\nOBX|3|TX|22635-7^Path report.microscopic observation^LN|1|MICROSCOPIC EXAM SHOWS HISTOLOGICALLY\r\nNORMAL GALLBLADDER TISSUE|...<cr>\r\nOBX|4|CWE|34574-4^Path report.final diagnosis^LN|1|M-00100^NML^SNM|...<cr>\r\nOBX|5|CWE|11529-5&ANT^Surgical Path Report^LN|2|T66000^APPENDIX^SNM|...<cr>\r\nOBX|6|TX|22634-0^Path report.gross observation^LN|2|THIS IS A RED, INFLAMED, SWOLLEN, BOGGY APPENDIX|...<cr>\r\nOBX|7|TX|22635-7^Path report.microscopic observation^LN|2|INFILTRATION WITH MANY PMN's - INDICATING INFLAMATORY CHANGE|...<cr>\r\nOBX|8|CWE|34574-4^Path report.final diagnosis^LN|2|M-40000^INFLAMMATION NOS^SNM|...<cr>\r\n\r\nThe example in Figure 7-2 has two segments for each component of the report, one for each of the two tissues. Thus, there are two 88304&ANT segments; there are two \"22634-0^Path report.gross observation^LN\" segments, and there are two \"22635-7^Path report.microscopic observation^LN\" segments. Segments that apply to the gallbladder all have the sub-identifier 1. Segments that apply to the appendix all have sub-identifier 2.\r\n\r\nThe observation sub ID has other grouping uses. It can be used to organize the reporting of some kinds of fluid intakes and outputs. For example, when intake occurs through multiple intravenous lines, a number of separate observations (OBX segments), the intake volume, the type of intake (Blood, D5W, Plasma, etc.), the site of the IV line, etc. may be needed for each intravenous line, each requiring a separate OBX segment. If more than one IV line is running, we can logically link all of the OBX segments that pertain to the first IV line by assigning them an observation sub ID of 1. We can do the same with the second IV line by assigning them a sub ID 2 and so on. The same would apply to the outputs of surgical drains when there are multiple such drains.\r\n\r\nThe use of the sub ID to distinguish repeating OBXs for the same observation ID is really a special case of using the sub ID to group, as can be seen if we picture the OBX segments as part of a table where the rows correspond to a particular species of observation and the cells correspond to the sub ID numbers that would be associated with each corresponding OBX.\r\n\r\nThe use of Sub IDs to group results is equivalent to defining a table, and the use of sub IDs to distinguish repeats is just a special case, represented by one column in this table.\r\n\r\nHowever, this approach introduces ambiguities if we have a set of repeating observations within a group, e.g., if the appendix observations include two impressions as in the 8th and 9th OBXs shown in the following example. This really represents the existence of a row nested within a single cell of the table.\r\nOBX|1|CWE|880304&ANT|1|T57000^GALLBLADDER^SNM|...<cr>\r\nOBX|2|TX|22634-0^Path report.gross observation^LN|1|THIS IS A NORMAL GALL BLADDER|...<cr>\r\nOBX|3|TX|22635-7^Path report.microscopic observation^LN|1|MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION SHOWS HISTOLOGICALLY\r\nNORMAL GALLBLADDER TISSUE|...<cr>\r\nOBX|4|CWE|34574-4^Path report.final diagnosis^LN|1|M-00100^NML^SNM|...<cr>\r\nOBX|5|CWE|880304&ANT|2|T57000^APPENDIX^SNM|...<cr>\r\nOBX|6|TX|22634-0^Path report.gross observation^LN|2|THIS IS A RED, INFLAMED APPENDIX|...<cr>\r\nOBX|7|TX|22635-7^Path report.microscopic observation^LN|2|INFLAMMATION WITH MANY PUS CELLS-ACUTE INFLAMMATION|...<cr>\r\nOBX|8|CWE|34574-4^Path report.final diagnosis^LN|2|M-40000^INFLAMMATION NOS^SNM|...<cr>\r\nOBX|9|CWE|34574-4^Path report.final diagnosis^LN|2|M-30280^FECALITH^SNM|...<cr>\r\n\r\nThe text under OBX-5-observation value provides guidance about dealing with two OBXs with the same observation ID and observation sub IDs. They are sent and replaced as a unit. However, some systems will take this to mean that the set of OBXs is to be combined into one composite observation in the receiving system. We suggest the use of a dot and a string (similar to the Dewey Decimal system) when users wish to distinguish each of the repeats within one type, or results within a cell for editing and correction purposes. Using this system, the previous example would become the following below. If there are cases where such nesting occurs at even deeper levels, this approach could be extended.\r\nOBX|1|CWE|880304&ANT|1|T57000^GALLBLADDER^SNM|...<cr>\r\nOBX|2|TX|22634-0^Path report.gross observation^LN|1|THIS IS A NORMAL GALL BLADDER|...<cr>\r\nOBX|3|TX|22635-7^Path report.microscopic observation^LN|1|MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION SHOWS HISTOLOGICALLY\r\nNORMAL GALLBLADDER TISSUE|...<cr>\r\nOBX|4|CWE|34574-4^Path report.final diagnosis^LN|1|M-00100^NML^SNM|...<cr>\r\nOBX|5|CWE|880304&ANT|2|T57000^APPENDIX^SNM|...<cr>\r\nOBX|6|TX|22634-0^Path report.gross observation^LN|2|THIS IS A RED, INFLAMED APPENDIX|...<cr>\r\nOBX|7|TX|22635-7^Path report.microscopic observation^LN|2|INFLAMMATION WITH MANY PUS CELLS-ACUTE INFLAMMATION|...<cr>\r\nOBX|8|CWE|34574-4^Path report.final diagnosis^LN|2.1|M-40000^INFLAMMATION NOS^SNM|...<cr>\r\nOBX|9|CWE|34574-4^Path report.final diagnosis^LN|2.2|M-30280^FECALITH^SNM|...<cr>\r\n\r\nUse a null or 1 when there is no need for multiples.\r\n\r\nIf the observation includes a number of OBXs with the same value for the observation ID OBX-3, then one must use different values for the sub-ID. This is in fact the case of the repeats depicted above, but without any need to group sets of OBXs. Three such OBXs could be distinguished by using sub-IDs 1, 2 etc. alternatively, sub-IDs 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 could be used. The following example shows and example of an electrocardiograph chest radiograph report with three diagnostic impressions, using 1,2,3 in the sub-ID field to distinguish the three separate results.\r\nOBX|1|CWE|8601-7^EKG IMPRESSION ^LN|1|^atrial fibrillation|...<cr>\r\nOBX|2|CWE|8601-7^EKG IMPRESSION ^LN|2|^OLD SEPTAL MYOCARDIAL INFARCT|...<cr>\r\nOBX|3|CWE|8601-7^EKG IMPRESSION ^LN|3|^poor R wave progression|...<cr>","sample":"","fields":[]},{"id":"OBX.5","type":"Field","position":"OBX.5","name":"Observation Value","length":0,"usage":"C","rpt":"*","dataType":"varies","dataTypeName":"Varies","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":"This field contains the value observed by the observation producer. OBX-2-value type contains the data type for this field according to which observation value is formatted. It is not a required field because some systems will report only the Interpretation Codes (OBX-8), especially in product experience reporting. The length of the observation field is variable, depending upon OBX-3-value type. This field may repeat for multipart, single answer results.\r\n\r\nRepresentation\r\nThis field contains the value of OBX-3-observation identifier of the same segment. Depending upon the observation, the data type may be a number (e.g., a respiratory rate), a coded answer (e.g., a pathology impression recorded as SNOMED), or a date/time (the date/time that a unit of blood is sent to the ward). An observation value is always represented as the data type specified in OBX-2-value type of the same segment. Whether numeric or short text, the answer shall be recorded in ASCII text.\r\n\r\nReporting logically independent observations\r\nThe main sections of dictated reports, such as radiologic studies or history and physicals, are reported as separate OBX segments. In addition, each logically independent observation should be reported in a separate OBX segment, i.e., one OBX segment should not contain the result of more than one logically independent observation. This requirement is included to assure that the contents of OBX-6-units, OBX-8-interpretation codes, and OBX-9-probability can be interpreted unambiguously. The electrolytes and vital signs batteries, for example, would each be reported as four separate OBX segments. Two diagnostic impressions, e.g., congestive heart failure and pneumonia, would also be reported as two separate OBX segments whether reported as part of a discharge summary or chest X-ray report. Similarly, two bacterial organisms isolated in a single bacterial culture would be reported as two separate OBX segments.\r\n\r\nThough two independent diagnostic statements cannot be reported in one OBX segment, multiple categorical responses are allowed (usually as CWE data types separated by repeat delimiters), so long as they are fragments (modifiers) that together construct one diagnostic statement. Right upper lobe (recorded as one code) and pneumonia (recorded as another code), for example, could be both reported in one OBX segment. Such multiple \"values\" would be separated by repeat delimiters.\r\n\r\nMultiple OBX segments with the same observation ID and Sub ID\r\nIn some systems, a single observation may include fragments of more than one data type. The most common example is a numeric result followed by coded comments (CWE). In this case, the logical observation can be sent in more than one OBX segment. For example, one segment of numeric or string data type for the numeric result and another segment of CWE data type for coded comments. If the producer was reporting multiple coded comments they would all be sent in one OBX segment separated by repeat delimiters because they all modified a single logical observation. Multiple OBX segments with the same observation ID and sub ID should always be sent in sequence with the most significant OBX segment (the one that has the normal flag/units and or reference range and status flag) first. The value of OBX-6 through 12 should be null in any following OBX segments with the same OBX-3-observation identifier and OBX-4-observation sub-ID. For the purpose of replacement or deletion, multiple OBX segments with the same observation ID and sub ID are treated as a unit. If any are replaced or deleted, they all are replaced.\r\n\r\nCoded values\r\nWhen an OBX segment contains values of CWE data types, the observations are stored as a combination of codes and/or text. In Section 7.7.3, \"CSS - Clinical Study Data Schedule Segment,\" examples of results that are represented as CWE data types are shown in the first and second OBX segments of OBR 1 and the first and second OBX segments of OBR 2. The observation may be an observation battery ID (for recommended studies), a diagnostic code or finding (for a diagnostic impression), or an anatomic site for a pathology report, or any of the other kinds of coded results.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to always encode the information stored within a coded observation. For example, a chest X-ray impression could be transmitted as pure text even though it has a CWE data type. In this case, the test must be recorded as the second component of the result code, e.g.,\r\nOBX|1|CWE|19005^X-Ray Impression^LN|1|^CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.|...<cr>\r\n\r\nHowever, separate impressions, recommendations, etc., even if recorded as pure text, should be recorded in separate result segments. That is, congestive heart failure and pneumonia should not be sent as:\r\nOBX|1|CWE|19005^X-Ray Impression^LN|1|^CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE AND PNEUMONIA|...<cr>\r\n\r\nbut as:\r\nOBX|1|CWE|19005^X-Ray Impression^LN|1|^CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE|...<cr>\r\nOBX|2|CWE|19005^X-Ray Impression^LN|2|^PNEUMONIA|....<cr>\r\n\r\nEven better would be fully-coded results that include computer understandable codes (component 1) instead of, or in addition to, the text description (component 2). One may include multiple values in a CWE value and these can be mixtures of code and text, but only when they are needed to construct one diagnosis, impression, or concept. When text follows codes as an independent value it would be taken as a modifier or addenda to the codes. E.g.,\r\nOBX|1|CWE|19005-8^X-ray impression^LN~29548-5^DiagnosisImpPatient^LN |1|428.0^CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE^I9C~^MASSIVE HEART|...<cr>\r\n\r\nThe text in component 2 should be an accurate description of the code in component 1. Likewise, if used, the text in component 5 should be an accurate description of the code in component 4.\r\n\r\nCDA documents are to be exchanged in the OBX segment. The value of OBX-2-Value Type should be set to 'ED'. OBX-5-Observation Value contains the MIME package encoded as an encapsulated data type. The components should be valued as follows:\r\n- Set the value of OBX-5.2-Type of Data to 'multipart.'\r\n- Set the value of OBX-5.3-Data Subtype to '-hl7-cda-level-one.'\r\n- Set the value of OBX-5.4-Encoding to 'A'. (Note that a MIME package is not itself Base64-encoded. Rather entities within the MIME package are Base64-encoded. A MIME package is sent as ASCII text. Therefore, the correct value is 'A' not 'Base64.'\r\n- Set the value of OBX-5.5-Data to equal the MIME package. Every entity within the MIME package must be Base64-encoded. As stated in Chapter 2, \"the data component must be scanned before transmission for HL7 delimiter characters (and other non-printing ASCII or non-ASCII characters such as LineFeed), and any found must be escaped by using the HL7 escape sequences defined in Section 2.7 'Use of escape sequences in text fields.' On the receiving application, the data field must be de-escaped after being parsed.\" As a result, CR/LF sequences required in the MIME package need to be escaped (i.e., converted to '\\X0D0A\\') prior to transmission. The content type of the first MIME entity is set to 'application/x-hl7-cda-level-one+xml', and should contain the CDA document itself. Multimedia objects referenced by the CDA document that need to be transmitted within the CDA document are to be placed in successive entities of the MIME package.","sample":"","fields":[]},{"id":"OBX.6","type":"Field","position":"OBX.6","name":"Units","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","tableId":"9999","tableName":"no table for CE","description":"This field contains the units of measurement for the value in OBX-5, Observation Value.

Refer to HL7 table 0085 - Observation result status codes interpretation for valid values. This field reflects the current completion status of the results for one Observation Identifier.\r\n\r\nIt is a required field. Previous versions of HL7 stated this implicitly by defining a default value of \"F.\" Code F indicates that the result has been verified to be correct and final. Code W indicates that the result has been verified to be wrong (incorrect); a replacement (corrected) result may be transmitted later. Code C indicates that data contained in the OBX-5-observation value field are to replace previously transmitted (verified and) final result data with the same observation ID (including suffix, if applicable) and observation sub-ID usually because the previous results were wrong. Code D indicates that data previously transmitted in a result segment with the same observation ID (including suffix) and observation sub-ID should be deleted. When changing or deleting a result, multiple OBX segments with the same observation ID and observation sub-ID are replaced or deleted as a unit. Normal progression of results through intermediate (e.g., ‘gram positive cocci’) to final (e.g., ‘staphylococcus aureus’) should not be transmitted as C (correction); they should be transmitted as P (depending upon the specific case) until they are final.\r\n\r\nIf an observation involves multiple OBX segments with the same observation ID (including suffix) and observation sub-ID, the observation result status applies to all OBX segments, except where the value is D or X. The value of D or X is applicable only to the individual OBX. All other OBX segments with the same Observation ID and observation sub-ID must have the same value.\r\n\r\nIn the case of coding systems such as LOINC, the preceding rules typically mean that this field applies to a single OBX segment.\r\n\r\nThere are situations where the observation battery required for the order needs to be dynamically specified at the time of ordering. That is, this battery is then defined by the set of OBX segments transmitted along with the order and generated by the placing system. For example, timed measurements of serum glucose challenge tests may vary among laboratories. One institution may report them at –30, -15, 0, 30, 60, and 120 minutes, while another may report them at –30, 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes. Master file entries may exist for each individual element of the battery but not for the battery itself. Another example may be Renin Studies where the specification may be done upon ordering without having a master file definition for each permutation of the possible element. The OBX segments in the ORM message can be used to create dynamic specifications to accommodate these permutations without defining pre-existing master file definitions for the battery itself. The result status field in the OBX can be used to indicate whether the OBX in the ORM message is used to provide a dynamic specification or is used to communicate a result as context to the order. The status of O shall be used to indicate that the OBX segment is used for a dynamic specification of the required result.

An example is an antimicrobial susceptibility result. Some systems prefer to display only the susceptibility results of inexpensive antimicrobials depending upon the organism, the source of the specimen and the patient’s allergy status. The sending service wants to send all of the susceptibilities so that certain privileged users (e.g., Infectious Disease specialists) can review all of the results but non-privileged users would see only the \"preferred\" antimicrobials to which the organism was susceptible.

In France, requesting services routinely send a set of the last observations along with the request for a new set of observations. The date of these observations is important to the filler laboratories.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, the observation date-time is the physiologically relevant date-time or the closest approximation to that date-time. In the case of tests performed on specimens, the relevant date-time is the specimen’s collection date-time.
