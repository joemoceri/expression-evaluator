{"id":"QBP_Q11","msgStructId":"QBP_Q11","eventDesc":"Query by parameter requesting an RSP segment pattern response","description":"The QBP_Q11 structure supports a Segment Pattern Response and contains the MSH, QPD, RCP, and DSC segments.  Its default trigger event is Q11.  A standard or site-defined query may use this trigger event or may specify a unique trigger event value in its Query Profile.  If a unique trigger event value is chosen for a site-defined query, that value SHALL begin with Z. \r\n\r\nNote on QBP: Query By Example variant:  The query by example is an extension of Query by Parameter (QBP) in which search parameters are passed by sending them in the segment which naturally carries them. A Query Profile which uses this variant SHALL replace the ellipses in the input QBP_Q11 grammar above, with the specific segments that it accepts. \r\n\r\nNote:  The indicated trigger events are the default values for MSH-9-2-Trigger event.  Standard and site-defined queries may use these trigger events or may specify unique trigger event values in their Query Profiles.  Unique trigger event values for site-defined queries SHALL begin with Z.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_05"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","segmentId":null,"longName":"Message Header","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"SFT","segmentId":null,"longName":"Software Segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"2","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"UAC","segmentId":null,"longName":"User Authentication Credential Segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"3","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"QPD","segmentId":null,"longName":"Query Parameter Definition","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"4","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"segmentId":null,"longName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"Hxx","segmentId":null,"longName":"Any Hl7 Segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"5","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":"RCP","segmentId":null,"longName":"Response Control Parameter","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"6","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"DSC","segmentId":null,"longName":"Continuation Pointer","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"7","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}
