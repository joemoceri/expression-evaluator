When using the STF and PRA segments in the Staff/Practitioner Master File message, MFE-4-primary key value is used to link all the segments pertaining to the same master file entry.  Therefore, in the MFE segment, MFE-4-primary key value must be filled in.  Other segments may follow the STF segment to provide data for a particular type of staff member. The PRA segment (practitioner) is one such.  It may optionally follow the STF segment in order to add practitioner-specific data. Other segments may be defined as needed.
