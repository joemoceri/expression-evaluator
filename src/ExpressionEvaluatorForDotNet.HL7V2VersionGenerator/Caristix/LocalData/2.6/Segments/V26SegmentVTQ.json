{"id":"VTQ","segmentId":"VTQ","longName":"Virtual Table Query Request","description":"The VTQ segment is used to define queries that are responded to with the Tabular Data Message (TBR).  The VTQ query message is an alternate method to the EQQ query message that some systems may find easier to implement, due to its use of HL7 delimiters that separate components of the selection definition, and its limited selection criteria.  Queries involving complex selection criteria (nested operators, etc.) may need to be formatted as an EQL segment. \r\n\r\nAs with the other query methods, the functional chapters define specific queries supported as VTQ messages.
