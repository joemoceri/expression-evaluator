{"id":"SID","segmentId":"SID","longName":"Substance Identifier","description":"The Substance Identifier segment contains data necessary to identify the substance (e.g., reagents) used in the production of analytical test results. The combination of these fields must uniquely identify the substance, i.e., depending on the manufacturer all or some fields are required (this is the reason the optionality is 'C' (conditional)). If the analysis requires multiple substances, this segment is repeated for each substance. The segment(s) should be attached to the TCD segment.","sample":"","chapters":["CH_13"],"fields":[{"id":"SID.1","type":"Field","position":"SID.1","name":"Application / Method Identifier","length":705,"usage":"C","rpt":"1","dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded with Exceptions","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"SID.2","type":"Field","position":"SID.2","name":"Substance Lot Number","length":20,"usage":"C","rpt":"1","dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"SID.3","type":"Field","position":"SID.3","name":"Substance Container Identifier","length":200,"usage":"C","rpt":"1","dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"SID.4","type":"Field","position":"SID.4","name":"Substance Manufacturer Identifier","length":705,"usage":"C","rpt":"1","dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded with Exceptions","tableId":"0385","tableName":"Manufacturer identifier","description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null}],"sequence":null,"usage":null,"rpt":null,"isGroup":false,"segments":null}
