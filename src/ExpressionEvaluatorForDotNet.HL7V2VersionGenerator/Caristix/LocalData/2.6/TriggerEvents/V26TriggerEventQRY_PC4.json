If version ID is absent, it will be interpreted to have the same value as the HL7 version number in the message header.","sample":"","fields":[]},{"id":"QRF.9.11.8","type":"SubComponent","position":"QRF.9.11.8","name":"Alternate Coding System Version Id","length":10,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":"This component carries the version for the coding system identified by components 4-6.","sample":"","fields":[]},{"id":"QRF.9.11.9","type":"SubComponent","position":"QRF.9.11.9","name":"Original Text","length":199,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":"The original text that was available to an automated process or a human before a specific code was assigned.","sample":"","fields":[]}]},{"id":"QRF.9.12","type":"Component","position":"QRF.9.12","name":"Total Occurrences","length":4,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"NM","dataTypeName":"Numeric","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":"This component contains the total number of occurrences of a service that should result from this order.
