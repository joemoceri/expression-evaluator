The conjunction of \"A\" specifies two parallel instructions, as are sometimes used in medication, e.g., prednisone given at 1 tab on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and at 1/2 tab on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, Sunday."},{"value":"C","description":"Actuation Time","comment":"It will be followed by a completion time for the service. This code allows one to distinguish between the time and priority at which a service should be actuated (e.g., blood should be drawn) and the time and priority at which a service should be completed (e.g., results should be reported)."},{"value":"S","description":"Synchronous","comment":"Do the next specification after this one (unless otherwise constrained by the following fields: TQ1-7-start date/time and TQ1-8-end date/time). An \"S\" specification implies that the second timing sequence follows the first, e.g., when a service request is written to measure blood pressure Q15 minutes for the 1st hour, then every 2 hours for the next day."}]}
