{"id":"OUL_R23","msgStructId":"OUL_R23","eventDesc":"Unsolicited Specimen Container Oriented Observation Message","description":"This message was designed to accommodate specimen oriented testing. It should be applicable to, for example, laboratory automation systems requiring container.\r\n\r\nGenerally this construct allows transfer of multiple results related to one or more specific containers with one or more specimens from a patient.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the patient results themselves it permits the communication of the following kinds of information:\r\n- Analysis results of a non patient related sample (e.g., environmental) â€“ patient related segments (e.g., PID, PD1, PV1, PV2) are optional.\r\n- Analysis results to a particular container with QC sample and the lot and manufacturer information about this sample (SAC-INV segments).\r\n- Basic identification data (lot, manufacturer, etc.) of the reagents and other substances involved in the generation of analysis results (TCD-SID segments).\r\n\r\nRefer to Chapter 13 Laboratory Automation for additional examples of usage of SAC.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_07"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","segmentId":null,"longName":"Message
