To identify, for example, tests that include a glucose challenge.

To construct this text string, use the following template.  (Note:  This field is not constructed of formally defined components; it is a free text field.  Component delimiters are not used and it is not necessary to supply placeholders if some ""components"" are not used.)

The time delay follows the syntax: n<S|M|H|D|W> where n is a number (possibly a decimal); S denotes seconds; M denotes minutes; H denotes hours; D denotes days; and W denotes weeks.  The time delay can be preceded by a 'greater than' (>) sign, e.g. >4H.


HL7 Table 0256 - Time delay post challenge lists possible values for time delay.

We denote the route of the challenge via abbreviations for medication routes (see HL7 table 0162 - Route of administration).  An oral route of administration would be denoted by ""PO,"" an intravenous route by ""IV."" 

Details of the drug dose, time the dose was given, route of administration, etc., would be noted in separate OBX, and would have corresponding master observation definitions stored in the observation master file map to different records stored in the master file segments contained in the drug level message.

For drug peak and trough measures the nature of the substance challenged is the same as the analyte name, and need not be included. 

The nature of a physiologic (non-drug) challenge may also be specified, using the terms in HL7 Table 0257 - Nature of challenge.",

To identify, for example, tests that include a glucose challenge.

To construct this text string, use the following template.  (Note:  This field is not constructed of formally defined components; it is a free text field.  Component delimiters are not used and it is not necessary to supply placeholders if some ""components"" are not used.)

The time delay follows the syntax: n<S|M|H|D|W> where n is a number (possibly a decimal); S denotes seconds; M denotes minutes; H denotes hours; D denotes days; and W denotes weeks.  The time delay can be preceded by a 'greater than' (>) sign, e.g. >4H.


HL7 Table 0256 - Time delay post challenge lists possible values for time delay.

We denote the route of the challenge via abbreviations for medication routes (see HL7 table 0162 - Route of administration).  An oral route of administration would be denoted by ""PO,"" an intravenous route by ""IV."" 

Details of the drug dose, time the dose was given, route of administration, etc., would be noted in separate OBX, and would have corresponding master observation definitions stored in the observation master file map to different records stored in the master file segments contained in the drug level message.

For drug peak and trough measures the nature of the substance challenged is the same as the analyte name, and need not be included. 

The nature of a physiologic (non-drug) challenge may also be specified, using the terms in HL7 Table 0257 - Nature of challenge.",
