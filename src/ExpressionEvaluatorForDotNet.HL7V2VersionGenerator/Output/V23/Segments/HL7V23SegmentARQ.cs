If a new appointment must be booked, it may be necessary to provide a schedule ID to uniquely identify the intended slot(s) being requested in the transaction.  After the request has been assigned to one or more slots, however, the filler application should assign a unique filler appointment ID (see Sections 10.5.1.1, “Placer appointment ID  (EI)   00860,” and 10.5.1.2, “Filler appointment ID  (EI)   00861 ).”  This filler appointment ID, as its definition indicates, should uniquely identify the appointment among all such requests and appointments within the filler application.  This means that, once assigned, the filler appointment ID should uniquely identify the appointment (either as a request or as a booked appointment) without a need to provide the schedule ID too.  As a cautionary note regarding implementation, if the filler appointment ID would not otherwise be unique, it may be necessary to include the schedule ID as part of the filler appointment ID.

The TS (time stamp) data type allows for two components:  the time stamp, and a degree of precision.  If used, the degree of precision should be separated from the time stamp by a subcomponent delimiter.

If only the range start date/time has been provided, then the range end date/time is assumed to be infinity.  Using this scenario is equivalent to requesting the next available slot on/after a particular date and time.  If only the range end date/time has been provided, then the range start date/time is assumed to be immediate.  Using this scenario is equivalent to requesting the appointment start some time between the current date and time, and the specified range end date/time.  Requesting an appointment when the range start and range end date/time are the same is equivalent to requesting a specific slot on a schedule.  If this field is unvalued, then the filler application will assume that the next available slot should be scheduled, using the institution’s processing rules for scheduling appointments.

This field may repeat.  Repetitions of this field are used to construct a list of acceptable ranges.  Repetitions of this field are connected with a logical OR to construct this list.  This procedure allows applications to provide multiple preferences for the scheduling of appointments.  Applications should take steps to ensure that nonsensical ranges are not indicated in this field (for example, redundant ranges). ",
