When the LCH segment appears immediately following the LDP segment, it communicates characteristics which differ for different departments that may use the same room.

This indicates how the room is set up and intended to be used, disregarding different uses under special circumstances.  Refer to user-defined table 0263 - Level of care

When LCH-4-location characteristic ID contains “IFD”- Infectious disease, refer to HL7 table 0136 - Yes/no indicator for valid values for LRL-5-location relationship value.    
- Y patients with infectious diseases can be admitted to this location, that is, this location can be used for isolation
- N this location cannot be used for isolation

When LCH-4-location characteristic ID contains “SMO”- Smoking, refer to HL7 table 0136 - Yes/no indicator for valid values for LRL-5-location relationship value.
- Y this is a smoking location
- N this is a non-smoking location

- Y this location can be used by radiation implant patients
- N this location can not be used by radiation implant patients

When LCH-4-Location Characteristic ID contains “LIC”- Licensed, refer to HL7 table 0136 - Yes/no indicator for valid values for LRL-5-Location relationship value.
