Usage Note: If a person’s name has only one component, that name will be sent in XPN.1 Family Name. This is common practice in some countries such as Indonesia. This note does not cover the case where only one part of a person's multi-part name is known (e.g., only know ""John"" of ""John Doe"").",

Note: The called by component contains a name that could be categorized as a nickname using the name usage types in HL7 Table 0200 - Name type. Its use is reserved for instances in which the nickname is a single name part that is provided in addition to a name that has some other type, such as legal. It is understood that the ""called by"" name is not part of the full name. Where a nickname has more parts, possibly including a family name, a different XPN with a type of nickname should instead be used.
Examples:
 - James Robert Smith is Called By Jim Bob
 - James Robert Smith is Called By JR
 - Peter Richard Smith is Called By Richard
 - Mary Margaret Elizabeth Jones is Called By Meg.",
