It can be used for any type of pharmacy order, including inpatient (unit dose and compound unit dose), outpatient, IVs, and hyperalimentation IVs (nutritional IVs), as well as other non-pharmacy treatments, e.g., respiratory therapy, oxygen, and many nursing treatments.

In addition to the pharmaceutical/treatment information, this segment contains additional data such as provider and text comments.

Examples of treatments products include medications and certain devices or supplies, e.g., inhaler spacers, blood glucose monitors, syringes, infusion sets, which might require prescription.

Often the coded entry implies dosage form and a dosage form is required in addition to the product name. When the give code does not include the dosage form, use RXO-5-requested dosage form. When the give code does not include the strength, use RXO-18-requested give strength and the RXO-19-requested give units. Realize that strengths do not apply to some such orders.

The RXO-1, RXO-2 and RXO-4 are mandatory unless the prescription/treatment is transmitted as free text using RXO-6; then RXO-1, RXO-2, and RXO-4 may be blank and the first subcomponent of RXO-6 must be blank.

Use of the RXO-6.2 versus the RXO-1.2 for a free text order is dependent on whether or not the free text describes a product or if it is more commentary in nature.

The need for strength and strength unit fields in addition to the amount and amount units fields included in various RX_ segments requires explanation. Physicians can write a prescription for a drug such as Ampicillin in two ways. One way would be: ""Ampicillin 250 mg capsules, 2 capsules four times a day.""  In this case the give amount would be 2, the give units would be capsules, the strength would be 250 and the strength units would milligrams.

However, the provider could also write the pharmaceutical treatment as ""Ampicillin 500 mg four times a day.""  In this case the give amount would be 500 and the give units would be milligrams.  The strength would not be reported in the RXO segment because it is not specified; the drug could be given in two 250 mg caps or one 500 mg cap. But the pharmacist would dispense a specific capsule size and would record the strength in the RXE segment as 250 or 500, depending upon which capsule size was dispensed.

Some coding systems imply the strength, units, route of administration, and manufacturer of substances within a single instructional code.  NDC codes, for example, usually imply not only the medical substance, but also the strength, the units, and the form, e.g., 0047-0402-30^Ampicillin 250 MG CAPS^NDC.  So all of this information can also be completely specified in RXO-1-requested give code and in the analogous CE fields in other pharmacy/treatment segments.

Moods are meant to change the semantics of clinical data in a message when it is not inferable from the trigger event:  when the data can represent a past medication, a future medication (e.g., in a patient care plan), or in a request (e.g., as a reason for referral).

 As of v2.7 this component is required when CNE.1 is populated and CNE.14 is not populated. Both CNE.3 and CNE.14 may be populated. Receivers should not identify a code based on its position within the tuples (Identifier, Alternate Identifier, or Second Alternate Identifier) or position within a repeating field. Instead, the receiver should always examine the codingSystem as specified in CNE.3 and/or CNE.14 the Coding System component or the Coding System OID for the tuple.The combination of the identifier and name of coding system represent a unique concept for a data item.

Some organizations that publish code sets author more than one. The coding system, then, to be unique, is a concatenation of the name of the coding authority organization and the name of its code set or table. When an HL7 table is used for a CNE data type, the name of coding system component is defined as HL7nnnn where nnnn is the HL7 table number. Similarly, ISO tables will be named ISOnnnn, where nnnn is the ISO table number.

Usage Note: The following statement is retained for backward compatibility as of v2.7. Best practice would recommend that this component always be populated. However, if the field narrative explicitly states ""Refer to HL7 Table nnnn for valid values”, and, if the sending and receiving systems are HL7 compliant, the coding system would be known from the standard.  This would be similar to a field with an ID data type, except that there is a second triplet in which to express an alternate code.",

Often the coded entry implies dosage form and a dosage form is required in addition to the product name. When the give code does not include the dosage form, use RXO-5-requested dosage form. When the give code does not include the strength, use RXO-18-requested give strength and the RXO-19-requested give units. Realize that strengths do not apply to some such orders.

Use of the RXO-6.2 versus the RXO-1.2 for a free text order is dependent on whether or not the free text describes a product or if it is more commentary in nature.

Note: 
This field is not a duplication of the first component of the quantity/timing field, since in non-pharmacy/treatment orders, that component can be used to specify multiples of an ordered amount. 
Another way to say this is that, for pharmacy/treatment orders, the quantity component of the quantity/timing field refers to what is to be given out at each service interval; thus, in terms of the RX order, that first component always defaults to 1. Hence, in the actual execution of the order, the value of 1 in the first component of the quantity/timing field always refers to one administration of the amount specified in this field (the Requested Give Amount field).",

Note on request-to-dispense fields:
Sometimes an order will be written in which the total amount of the drug or treatment requested to be dispensed has no direct relationship with the give amounts and schedule. For example, an outpatient pharmacy/treatment order might be take four tablets a day of <drug name, value>, Q6H (every 6 hours) -- dispense 30 tablets. An inpatient order might be NS/D5W (normal saline with 5% dextrose) at 1000cc/hour—dispense 3 1-liter bottles of NSD5W solution.

The need for strength and strength unit fields in addition to the amount and amount units fields included in various RX_ segments requires explanation. Physicians can write a prescription for a drug such as Ampicillin in two ways. One way would be: ""Ampicillin 250 mg capsules, 2 capsules four times a day.""  In this case the give amount would be 2, the give units would be capsules, the strength would be 250 and the strength units would milligrams.

However, the provider could also write the pharmaceutical treatment as ""Ampicillin 500 mg four times a day.""  In this case the give amount would be 500 and the give units would be milligrams.  The strength would not be reported in the RXO segment because it is not specified; the drug could be given in two 250 mg caps or one 500 mg cap. But the pharmacist would dispense a specific capsule size and would record the strength in the RXE segment as 250 or 500, depending upon which capsule size was dispensed.

Some coding systems imply the strength, units, route of administration, and manufacturer of substances within a single instructional code.  NDC codes, for example, usually imply not only the medical substance, but also the strength, the units, and the form, e.g., 0047-0402-30^Ampicillin 250 MG CAPS^NDC.  So all of this information can also be completely specified in RXO-1-requested give code and in the analogous CE fields in other pharmacy/treatment segments.  In this case, it is not necessary to use the strength and strength units fields to specify this information.",

There may appear to be overlap between this field and ORC-5 Order Status.  However, the intent of Mood Code is to support the description and documentation of historical events.  In this context, Mood codes may clash with Order Status codes, a Mood code may apply for different Order Status values, or this segment may be being used outside of the order paradigm (e.g., in a patient care plan).  Moods are meant to change the semantics of clinical data in a message when it is not inferable from the trigger event:  when the data can represent a past medication, a future medication (e.g., in a patient care plan), or in a request (e.g., as a reason for referral).  The reader is referred to Chapter 12, Patient Care, for further discussion of patient care plans and referrals.

Note: RXO-31 Mood Code was introduced in v2.6 to support Patient Care messaging concepts and constructs. At this time, there are no documented use cases for this field in the context of a pharmacy/treatment orders as described in this chapter. This statement does not preclude the use of RXO-31 in pharmacy messages, but implementers should exercise caution in using this field outside of the Patient Care context until the pharmacy/treatment use cases are established. While a similar note exists for RXO-29 Medication Instance Identifier and RXO-30 Segment Instance Identifier, particular care should be taken with RXO-31 as this could modify the intent of the segment/message and create backward compatibility problems.",
