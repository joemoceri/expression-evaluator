For example, the RXC segments may specify a recipe for a liter of a standard type of saline with 1 gram of a particular antimicrobial, while the give amount (from the RXO) may specify the administration of 2 liters of this IV-solution every 24 hours.

The amount specified in each ""A"" segment is defined to be the quantity to be added to the amount of the base as specified in its RXC segment.

If any ""base"" components are present then these should be transmitted first. The first ""base"" component in the transmission should be considered the ""primary base"" if such a distinction is necessary.
