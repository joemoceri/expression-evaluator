Relationships are constrained to being between explicit segments of messages rather than beween the identities of entities they reference. Segments are available within the message but related persistent information may not be.  Because of the transient nature of messages applications must manage the associations with entities which persist outside or across messages.

Examples: 	
- Problem is a consequence of a diagnosis.
- Diagnosis is supported by observation.
- Observation is a manifestation of a diagnosis.
- Complication is a consequence of a procedure."; } }

As of v2.7, the Assigning Authority is conditional. It is required if XCN.1 is populated and neither XCN.22 nor XCN.23 are populated. All 3 components may be populated. No assumptions can be safely made based on position or sequence. Best practice is to send an OID in this component when populated.

The reader is referred to XCN.22 and XCN.23 if there is a need to transmit values with semantic meaning for an assigning jurisdiction or assigning department or agency in addition to, or instead of, an assigning authority. However, all 3 components may be valued.  If, in so doing, it is discovered that the values in XCN.22 and/or XCN.23 conflict with XCN.9, the user would look to the Message Profile or other implementation agreement for a statement as to which takes precedence.
Note: When the HD data type is used in a given segment as a component of a field of another data type, User-defined Table 0300 - Namespace ID (referenced by the first sub-component of the HD component) may be re-defined (given a different user-defined table number and name) by the technical committee responsible for that segment.
