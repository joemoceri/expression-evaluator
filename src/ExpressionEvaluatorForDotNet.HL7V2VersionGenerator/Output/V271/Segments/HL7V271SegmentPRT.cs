No assumptions can be safely made based on position or sequence. Best practice is to send an OID in this component when populated.

However, all 3 components may be valued.  If, in so doing, it is discovered that the values in XCN.22 and/or XCN.23 conflict with XCN.9, the user would look to the Message Profile or other implementation agreement for a statement as to which takes precedence.
