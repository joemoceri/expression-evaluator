Attention: As of v2.7, the Assigning Authority is conditional. It is required if PPN.1 is populated and neither PPN.23 nor PPN.24 are populated. All 3 components may be populated. No assumptions can be safely made based on position or sequence. Best practice is to send an OID in this component when populated.

The reader is referred to the PPN.23 and the PPN.24 if there is a need to transmit values with semantic meaning for an assigning jurisdiction or assigning department or agency in addition to, or instead of, an assigning authority. However, all 3 components may be valued. If, in so doing, it is discovered that the values in PPN.23 and/or PPN.24 conflict with PPN.9, the user would look to the Message Profile or other implementation agreement for a statement as to which takes precedence.",
