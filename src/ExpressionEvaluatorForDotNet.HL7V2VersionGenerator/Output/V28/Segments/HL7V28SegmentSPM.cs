It differs from the intent of the OBR in that the OBR addresses order-specific information. It differs from the SAC segment in that the SAC addresses specimen container attributes. An advantage afforded by a separate specimen segment is that it generalizes the multiple relationships among order(s), results, specimen(s) and specimen container(s).

A specimen is defined as ""A physical entity that is an individual, a group, an item, or a part representative of a larger group, class or whole that is the target of an observation or analysis for the purpose of drawing conclusions about the group, class, or whole."" Note that any physical entity in the universe has the potential to become a specimen

A specimen is collected or obtained from a source and may be representative of the source, or may represent a deviation within the source. A specimen may be wholly or partially consumed during an observation and any remaining portion of the specimen is persistent and can be stored.

This segment may also be used in limited cases to describe a ""virtual"" specimen. In particular, to identify the characteristics required for a specimen in the context of a specific observation or test.

In summary, SPM represents the attributes specific and unique to a specimen."; } }

This is populated with site-specific assigning authorities. It also should contain national or international codes when CX.5 Identifier Type Code may be assigned by more than one authority within a governmental or organizational unit. For example, a federal government may have 2 departments that assign a military identifier, its Veterans Affairs department and its Department of Defense. It is not recommended to include values for entities such as Social Security Administration (SSA), Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) because they are included in the identifier type table. In these cases the name of the country plus the identifier type yields the correct interpretation of the identifier in component 1. Likewise, entries like department of motor vehicles (DMV) and licensing boards are not recommended for inclusion because the combination of state and identifier type yields the correct interpretation of the identifier in component 1. This approach is not to be confused with the detailed information provided in the Chapter 15 segments that have provision for specifying the precise granting body and issuing body information needed in personnel management messages.

Example 1: <Identifier> plus <Visa> yields a unique identifier.

Example 2: <identifier> plus <state> plus <DLN> yields a unique driver’s license number.

Example 3: <identifier> plus <country> plus <INS> yields a unique immigration number.

Refer to User-defined Table 0530 – Organizations, agency, department for suggested values if the administrative unit under whose jurisdiction the identifier was issued is an organization, agency or department. This is populated with site-specific assigning authorities. It also should contain national or international codes when CX.5 Identifier Type Code may be assigned by more than one authority within a governmental or organizational unit. For example, a federal government may have 2 departments that assign a military identifier, its Veterans Affairs department and its Department of Defense. It is not recommended to include values for entities such as Social Security Administration (SSA), Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) because they are included in the identifier type table. In these cases the name of the country plus the identifier type yields the correct interpretation of the identifier in component 1. Likewise, entries like department of motor vehicles (DMV) and licensing boards are not recommended for inclusion because the combination of state and identifier type yields the correct interpretation of the identifier in component 1. This approach is not to be confused with the detailed information provided in the Chapter 15 segments that have provision for specifying the precise granting body and issuing body information needed in personnel management messages.

Example 1: <Identifier> plus <Visa> yields a unique identifier.

Example 2: <identifier> plus <state> plus <DLN> yields a unique driver’s license number.

Example 3: <identifier> plus <country> plus <INS> yields a unique immigration number.
