The facility ID, the optional fourth component of each patient location field, is a HD data type that is uniquely associated with the healthcare facility containing the location. A given institution, or group of intercommunicating institutions, should establish a list of facilities that may be potential assignors of patient locations. The list will be one of the institution's master dictionary lists. Since third parties other than the assignors of patient locations may send or receive HL7 messages containing patient locations, the facility ID in the patient location may not be the same as that implied by the sending and receiving systems identified in the MSH. The facility ID must be unique across facilities at a given site. This field is required for HL7 implementations that have more than a single healthcare facility with bed locations, since the same <point of care> ^ <room> ^ <bed> combination may exist at more than one facility."; } }

Refer to User-defined Table 0530 – Organizations, agency, department for suggested values if the administrative unit under whose jurisdiction the identifier was issued is an organization, agency or department. This is populated with site-specific assigning authorities. It also should contain national or international codes when CX.5 Identifier Type Code may be assigned by more than one authority within a governmental or organizational unit. For example, a federal government may have 2 departments that assign a military identifier, its Veterans Affairs department and its Department of Defense. It is not recommended to include values for entities such as Social Security Administration (SSA), Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) because they are included in the identifier type table. In these cases the name of the country plus the identifier type yields the correct interpretation of the identifier in component 1. Likewise, entries like department of motor vehicles (DMV) and licensing boards are not recommended for inclusion because the combination of state and identifier type yields the correct interpretation of the identifier in component 1. This approach is not to be confused with the detailed information provided in the Chapter 15 segments that have provision for specifying the precise granting body and issuing body information needed in personnel management messages.

Example 1: <Identifier> plus <Visa> yields a unique identifier.

Example 2: <identifier> plus <state> plus <DLN> yields a unique driver’s license number.

Example 3: <identifier> plus <country> plus <INS> yields a unique immigration number.

Each coding system is assigned a unique identifier. As of v2.7 this component is required when CWE.1 is populated and CWE.14 is not populated. Both CWE.3 and CWE.14 may be populated. Receivers should not identify a code based on its position within the tuples (Identifier, Alternate Identifier, or Second Alternate Identifier) or position within a repeating field. Instead, the receiver should always examine the codingSystem as specified in CWE.3 and/or CWE.14, the ""Coding System"" component or the ""Coding System OID"" for the tuple.

Refer to HL7 Table 0396 – Coding System in Chapter 2C, section ""Coding System Table"" for valid values. 

Refer to section 2.A.8.3, ""Name of Coding System (ID)"" for a discussion of coding system conventions.",

The reader is referred to XCN.22 and XCN.23 if there is a need to transmit values with semantic meaning for an assigning jurisdiction or assigning department or agency in addition to, or instead of, an assigning authority. However, all 3 components may be valued.  If, in so doing, it is discovered that the values in XCN.22 and/or XCN.23 conflict with XCN.9, the user would look to the Message Profile or other implementation agreement for a statement as to which takes precedence.

This is populated with site-specific assigning authorities. It also should contain national or international codes when CX.5 Identifier Type Code may be assigned by more than one authority within a governmental or organizational unit. For example, a federal government may have 2 departments that assign a military identifier, its Veterans Affairs department and its Department of Defense. It is not recommended to include values for entities such as Social Security Administration (SSA), Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) because they are included in the identifier type table. In these cases the name of the country plus the identifier type yields the correct interpretation of the identifier in component 1. Likewise, entries like department of motor vehicles (DMV) and licensing boards are not recommended for inclusion because the combination of state and identifier type yields the correct interpretation of the identifier in component 1. This approach is not to be confused with the detailed information provided in the Chapter 15 segments that have provision for specifying the precise granting body and issuing body information needed in personnel management messages.

Example 1: <Identifier> plus <Visa> yields a unique identifier.

Example 2: <identifier> plus <state> plus <DLN> yields a unique driver’s license number.

Example 3: <identifier> plus <country> plus <INS> yields a unique immigration number.

Refer to User-defined Table 0530 – Organizations, agency, department for suggested values if the administrative unit under whose jurisdiction the identifier was issued is an organization, agency or department. This is populated with site-specific assigning authorities. It also should contain national or international codes when CX.5 Identifier Type Code may be assigned by more than one authority within a governmental or organizational unit. For example, a federal government may have 2 departments that assign a military identifier, its Veterans Affairs department and its Department of Defense. It is not recommended to include values for entities such as Social Security Administration (SSA), Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) because they are included in the identifier type table. In these cases the name of the country plus the identifier type yields the correct interpretation of the identifier in component 1. Likewise, entries like department of motor vehicles (DMV) and licensing boards are not recommended for inclusion because the combination of state and identifier type yields the correct interpretation of the identifier in component 1. This approach is not to be confused with the detailed information provided in the Chapter 15 segments that have provision for specifying the precise granting body and issuing body information needed in personnel management messages.

Example 1: <Identifier> plus <Visa> yields a unique identifier.

Example 2: <identifier> plus <state> plus <DLN> yields a unique driver’s license number.

Example 3: <identifier> plus <country> plus <INS> yields a unique immigration number.

This is populated with site-specific assigning authorities. It also should contain national or international codes when CX.5 Identifier Type Code may be assigned by more than one authority within a governmental or organizational unit. For example, a federal government may have 2 departments that assign a military identifier, its Veterans Affairs department and its Department of Defense. It is not recommended to include values for entities such as Social Security Administration (SSA), Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) because they are included in the identifier type table. In these cases the name of the country plus the identifier type yields the correct interpretation of the identifier in component 1. Likewise, entries like department of motor vehicles (DMV) and licensing boards are not recommended for inclusion because the combination of state and identifier type yields the correct interpretation of the identifier in component 1. This approach is not to be confused with the detailed information provided in the Chapter 15 segments that have provision for specifying the precise granting body and issuing body information needed in personnel management messages.

Example 1: <Identifier> plus <Visa> yields a unique identifier.

Example 2: <identifier> plus <state> plus <DLN> yields a unique driver’s license number.

Example 3: <identifier> plus <country> plus <INS> yields a unique immigration number.
