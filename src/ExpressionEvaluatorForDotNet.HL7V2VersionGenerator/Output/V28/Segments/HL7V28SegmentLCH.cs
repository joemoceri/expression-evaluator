When LCH-4-location characteristic ID contains ""SHA""- Shadow, refer to HL7 Table 0136 - Yes/no Indicator in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for valid values for LRL-5 - Organizational Location Relationship Value.
Y - not a real bed, but a temporary holding location that does not physically exist in the census
N - this is a real bed

When LCH-4 - Location Characteristic ID contains ""PRL""- Privacy level (CWE), then LRL-5 - Organizational Location Relationship Value indicates how the room is set up and intended to be used, disregarding different uses under special circumstances.  Refer to User-defined Table 0262 - Privacy Level in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for suggested values.

When LCH-4 - Location Characteristic ID contains ""LCR""- Level of care, then LRL-5 - Organizational Location Relationship Value contains the code which indicates what severity of the patient's medical condition which this location is designed to handle.  This indicates how the room is set up and intended to be used, disregarding different uses under special circumstances.  Refer to User-defined Table 0263 - Level of Care in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for suggested values.

When LCH-4 - Location Characteristic ID contains ""IFD""- Infectious disease, refer to HL7 Table 0136 - Yes/no Indicator in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for valid values for LRL-5 - Organizational Location Relationship Value.
Y - patients with infectious diseases can be admitted to this location, that is, this location can be used for isolation
N - this location cannot be used for isolation

When LCH-4 - Location Characteristic ID contains ""SMO""- Smoking, refer to HL7 Table 0136 - Yes/no Indicator in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for valid values for LRL-5 - Organizational Location Relationship Value.
Y - this is a smoking location
N - this is a non-smoking location

When LCH-4 - Location Characteristic ID contains ""IMP""- Implant, refer to HL7 Table 0136 - Yes/no Indicator in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for valid values for LRL-5 - Organizational Location Relationship Value.
Y - this location can be used by radiation implant patients
N - this location can not be used by radiation implant patients

When LCH-4 - Location Characteristic ID contains ""LIC""- Licensed, refer to HL7 Table 0136 - Yes/no Indicator in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for valid values for LRL-5 - Organizational Location Relationship Value.
