In a network environment, this segment can be used to define personnel to other applications, for example, order entry clerks, insurance verification clerks, admission clerks, as well as provider demographics. When using the STF and PRA segments in the Staff/Practitioner Master File message, MFE-4-primary key value is used to link all the segments pertaining to the same master file entry.  Therefore, in the MFE segment, MFE-4-primary key value must be filled in.  Other segments may follow the STF segment to provide data for a particular type of staff member. The PRA segment (practitioner) is one such.  It may optionally follow the STF segment in order to add practitioner-specific data. Other segments may be defined as needed. When using the segments included in this chapter for other then Staff/Practitioner Master File messages, disregard references to MFE-4 - primary key value."; } }

Refer to User-defined Table 0530 – Organizations, agency, department for suggested values if the administrative unit under whose jurisdiction the identifier was issued is an organization, agency or department. This is populated with site-specific assigning authorities. It also should contain national or international codes when CX.5 Identifier Type Code may be assigned by more than one authority within a governmental or organizational unit. For example, a federal government may have 2 departments that assign a military identifier, its Veterans Affairs department and its Department of Defense. It is not recommended to include values for entities such as Social Security Administration (SSA), Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) because they are included in the identifier type table. In these cases the name of the country plus the identifier type yields the correct interpretation of the identifier in component 1. Likewise, entries like department of motor vehicles (DMV) and licensing boards are not recommended for inclusion because the combination of state and identifier type yields the correct interpretation of the identifier in component 1. This approach is not to be confused with the detailed information provided in the Chapter 15 segments that have provision for specifying the precise granting body and issuing body information needed in personnel management messages.

Example 1: <Identifier> plus <Visa> yields a unique identifier.

Example 2: <identifier> plus <state> plus <DLN> yields a unique driver’s license number.

Example 3: <identifier> plus <country> plus <INS> yields a unique immigration number.

An enterprise might have more than one method to categorize or type resources at a high level. Therefore, this field can repeat.
