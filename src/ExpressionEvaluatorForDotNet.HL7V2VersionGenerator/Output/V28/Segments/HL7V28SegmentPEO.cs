Note: The called by component contains a name that could be categorized as a nickname using the name usage types in HL7 Table 0200 - Name type.

It is understood that the ""called by"" name is not part of the full name. Where a nickname has more parts, possibly including a family name, a different XPN with a type of nickname should instead be used.

 - James Robert Smith is Called By JR
 - Peter Richard Smith is Called By Richard
