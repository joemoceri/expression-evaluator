OM4 is a repeating segment.  It allows multiple specimens per Order Code and accommodates for multiple alternate specimen for each preferred specimen.  In some cases an Order Code can require multiple specimens.  In many cases there are preferred specimens and for each preferred it is possible to have one or more alternative specimens.  The alternative specimen will carry in OM4-17 the Sequence Number – Test/Observation Master File (OM4-1) of the preferred specimen."; } }
