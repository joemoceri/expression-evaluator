It differs from the intent of the OBR in that the OBR addresses order-specific information. It differs from the SAC segment in that the SAC addresses specimen container attributes. An advantage afforded by a separate specimen segment is that it generalizes the multiple relationships among order(s), results, specimen(s) and specimen container(s).

A specimen is defined as ""A physical entity that is an individual, a group, an item, or a part representative of a larger group, class or whole that is the target of an observation or analysis for the purpose of drawing conclusions about the group, class, or whole."" Note that any physical entity in the universe has the potential to become a specimen

A specimen is collected or obtained from a source and may be representative of the source, or may represent a deviation within the source. A specimen may be wholly or partially consumed during an observation and any remaining portion of the specimen is persistent and can be stored.

This segment may also be used in limited cases to describe a ""virtual"" specimen. In particular, to identify the characteristics required for a specimen in the context of a specific observation or test.

In summary, SPM represents the attributes specific and unique to a specimen."; } }

For example, if the specimen source site was precisely described as ‘left radial vein’ but the code set employed only provided ‘radial vein,’ this attribute could be employed to add the modifier ‘left.’

Each coding system is assigned a unique identifier. As of v2.7 this component is required when CWE.1 is populated and CWE.14 is not populated. Both CWE.3 and CWE.14 may be populated. Receivers should not identify a code based on its position within the tuples (Identifier, Alternate Identifier, or Second Alternate Identifier) or position within a repeating field. Instead, the receiver should always examine the codingSystem as specified in CWE.3 and/or CWE.14, the ""Coding System"" component or the ""Coding System OID"" for the tuple.

Refer to HL7 Table 0396 – Coding System in Chapter 2C, section ""Coding System Table"" for valid values. 

Refer to section 2.A.8.3, ""Name of Coding System (ID)"" for a discussion of coding system conventions.",
