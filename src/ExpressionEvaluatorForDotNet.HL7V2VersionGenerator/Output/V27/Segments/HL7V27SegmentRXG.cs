The composition and use of the barcode number is dependent on application negotiation. An example of this field follows: The barcode number is in the following format, 9XXXXXXX000. The number '9' is a constant, XXXXXXX is seven (7) characters for a unique identifier assigned or derived from the patient account and order ID and 000 is the zero-filled three (3) character IV bottle number.

The maximum length of the first component of this field is 40 characters to allow for the maximum existing barcode length in use today. The second component contains the description of the item being coded and the third component may define the barcode type.

The maximum length of the first component of this field is 40 characters to allow for the maximum existing barcode length in use today. The second component contains the description of the item being coded and the third component may define the barcode type.
