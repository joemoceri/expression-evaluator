In the explanations below the system means the LAS or any equipment interfaced to it or to another piece of equipment.
Identified status is used by one system to inform another that it has received a container.

In some cases this may not be equal to the first event of sample recognition.

In Position status is used by one system to inform another that the container is in position for specimen transfer (e.g., container removal from track, pipetting, etc.).
In Process status is used by one system to inform another that the specific container is being processed by the equipment. It is useful as a response to a query about Container Status, when the specific step of the process is not relevant.
Process Completed status is used by one system to inform another that the processing has been completed, but the container has not been released from that system.
Left Equipment status is used by one system to inform another that the container has been released from that system.
Missing status is used by one system to inform another that the container did not arrive at its next expected location.
Cancelled status is used by one system to inform another that the container is no longer available within the scope of the system (e.g., tube broken or discarded).
Unknown status is used by one system to inform another that the container has not been identified.",

Refer to HL7 Table 0370 - ContainerSstatus for valid values. The equipment specific container status should be sent as <alternate identifier> as needed.

The container states are relevant for the exchange of information among devices (within the LAS). Not all of them are relevant for information transfer between the LAS and the LIS.

In the explanations below the system means the LAS or any equipment interfaced to it or to another piece of equipment.
Identified status is used by one system to inform another that it has received a container. In the exchange between the LAS and LIS the Identified status can be used for reporting of the ""In Lab"" (Specimen Received) status. In some cases this may not be equal to the first event of sample recognition.

In Position status is used by one system to inform another that the container is in position for specimen transfer (e.g., container removal from track, pipetting, etc.).
In Process status is used by one system to inform another that the specific container is being processed by the equipment. It is useful as a response to a query about Container Status, when the specific step of the process is not relevant.
Process Completed status is used by one system to inform another that the processing has been completed, but the container has not been released from that system.
Left Equipment status is used by one system to inform another that the container has been released from that system.
Missing status is used by one system to inform another that the container did not arrive at its next expected location.
Cancelled status is used by one system to inform another that the container is no longer available within the scope of the system (e.g., tube broken or discarded).
Unknown status is used by one system to inform another that the container has not been identified.",
