Its principal mission is to carry information about observations in report messages. But the OBX can also be part of an observation order (see Chapter 4, section 4.4, ""General Trigger Events & Message Definitions""). In this case, the OBX carries clinical information needed by the filler to interpret the observation the filler makes. For example, an OBX is needed to report the inspired oxygen on an order for a blood oxygen to a blood gas lab, or to report the menstrual phase information which should be included on an order for a pap smear to a cytology lab. Appendix 7A includes codes for identifying many of pieces of information needed by observation producing services to properly interpret a test result. OBX is also found in other HL7 messages that need to include patient clinical information.

When using the OBX for the TIM category, OBX-2 Value Type should be valued to DTM. Consequently, OBX-5 Observation Value should have a length of 26 given the format of the DTM data type. Note the expectations on which fields are required as well as the fields that should not be valued.

When using the OBX for the CHN category, OBX-2 Value Type should be valued to CD. Consequently, OBX-5 Observation Value could have a length of up to 65536 given the format of the CD data type. Note the expectations on which fields are required as well as the fields that should not be valued.

When using the OBX for the WAV category, OBX-2 can be valued as either NA or MA. The length of OBX-5 Observation Value depends on the data type chosen. NA is a repeating data type, and the length will depend on the number of repeats. Note the expectations on which fields are required as well as the fields that should not be valued.

When using the OBX for the ANO category, OBX-2 Value Type should be valued to CWE. Consequently, OBX-5 Observation Value could have a length of up the 65536 given the format of the data types. Note the expectations on which fields are required as well as the fields that should not be valued."; } }

.
For example, if the value is ‘CWE’ then the result in OBX-5 must be a coded entry or text or both. As of v2.7, the ST data type may not be used to transmit data that can be more precisely transmitted using other data types, e.g. SN when comparative symbols are needed.

CQ is invalid because units for OBX-5-observation value are always specified explicitly in an OBX segment with OBX-6 units. SI is invalid because it only applies to HL7 message segments; ID is also invalid because it requires a constant field definition.

The RP value (reference pointer) must be used if the OBX-5 contains a pointer to the data e.g., a URL of an image. The receiving system can use this reference pointer whenever it needs access to the actual data through other interface standards, e.g., DICOM, or through appropriate data base servers.

The structured numeric (SN) data type provides for reporting ranges (e.g., 3-5 or 10-20), titres (e.g., 1:10), and out-of-range indicators (e.g., >50) in a structured and computer-interpretable way.

We allow the FT data type in the OBX segment, but its use is discouraged. Formatted text usually implies a meaningful structure, e.g., a list of three independent diagnoses reported on different lines. But ideally, the structure in three independent diagnostic statements would be reported as three separate OBX segments.

TX should not be used except to send large amounts of text. In the TX data type, the repeat delimiter can only be used to identify paragraph breaks. Use ST to send short, and possibly encodable, text strings.

CDA documents are to be exchanged in the OBX segment in any message that can exchange documents (such as MDM or ORU). Within the OBX segment, the MIME package is encoded as an encapsulated (ED) data type.",

In most systems the identifier will point to a master observation table that will provide other attributes of the observation that may be used by the receiving system to process the observations it receives. A set of message segments for transmitting such master observation tables is described in Chapter 8. The relation of an observation ID to a master observation table is analogous to the relationship between a charge code (in a billing record) and the charge master.

When local codes are used as the first identifier in this field we strongly encourage sending a universal identifier as well to permit receivers to equivalence results from different providers of the same service (e.g., a hospital lab and commercial lab that provides serum potassium to a nursing home). LOINC® is one possible universal and HL7-approved code system for the Observation identifier. It covers observations and measurements, such as laboratory tests, physical findings, radiology studies, and claims attachments. See HL7 Table 0396 – Coding System, the HL7 www list server and Appendix X2 of ASTM E1467 for neurophysiology tests, or it can be obtained from www.regenstrief.org/loinc/loinc.htm.

For example, a chest X-ray report might include three separate diagnostic impressions. The standard requires three OBX segments, one for each impression. By putting a 1 in the Sub-ID of the first of these OBX segments, 2 in the second, and 3 in the third, we can uniquely identify each OBX segment for editing or replacement.

The sub-identifier is also used to group related components in reports such as surgical pathology. It is traditional for surgical pathology reports to include all the tissues taken from one surgical procedure in one report. Consider, for example, a single surgical pathology report that describes the examination of gallbladder and appendix tissue. This report would be transmitted roughly as shown here:

The example in Figure 7-2 has two segments for each component of the report, one for each of the two tissues. Thus, there are two 88304&ANT segments; there are two ""22634-0^Path report.gross observation^LN"" segments, and there are two ""22635-7^Path report.microscopic observation^LN"" segments. Segments that apply to the gallbladder all have the sub-identifier 1. Segments that apply to the appendix all have sub-identifier 2.

The observation sub ID has other grouping uses. It can be used to organize the reporting of some kinds of fluid intakes and outputs. For example, when intake occurs through multiple intravenous lines, a number of separate observations (OBX segments), the intake volume, the type of intake (Blood, D5W, Plasma, etc.), the site of the IV line, etc. may be needed for each intravenous line, each requiring a separate OBX segment. If more than one IV line is running, we can logically link all of the OBX segments that pertain to the first IV line by assigning them an observation sub ID of 1. We can do the same with the second IV line by assigning them a sub ID 2 and so on. The same would apply to the outputs of surgical drains when there are multiple such drains.

The use of the sub ID to distinguish repeating OBXs for the same observation ID is really a special case of using the sub ID to group, as can be seen if we picture the OBX segments as part of a table where the rows correspond to a particular species of observation and the cells correspond to the sub ID numbers that would be associated with each corresponding OBX.

The use of Sub IDs to group results is equivalent to defining a table, and the use of sub IDs to distinguish repeats is just a special case, represented by one column in this table.

However, this approach introduces ambiguities if we have a set of repeating observations within a group, e.g., if the appendix observations include two impressions as in the 8th and 9th OBXs shown in the following example. This really represents the existence of a row nested within a single cell of the table.

The text under OBX-5-observation value provides guidance about dealing with two OBXs with the same observation ID and observation sub IDs. They are sent and replaced as a unit. However, some systems will take this to mean that the set of OBXs is to be combined into one composite observation in the receiving system. We suggest the use of a dot and a string (similar to the Dewey Decimal system) when users wish to distinguish each of the repeats within one type, or results within a cell for editing and correction purposes. Using this system, the previous example would become the following below. If there are cases where such nesting occurs at even deeper levels, this approach could be extended.

Use a null or 1 when there is no need for multiples.

If the observation includes a number of OBXs with the same value for the observation ID OBX-3, then one must use different values for the sub-ID. This is in fact the case of the repeats depicted above, but without any need to group sets of OBXs. Three such OBXs could be distinguished by using sub-IDs 1, 2 etc. alternatively, sub-IDs 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 could be used. The following example shows and example of an electrocardiograph chest radiograph report with three diagnostic impressions, using 1,2,3 in the sub-ID field to distinguish the three separate results.

OBX-2-value type contains the data type for this field according to which observation value is formatted. It is not a required field because some systems will report only the Interpretation Codes (OBX-8), especially in product experience reporting. The length of the observation field is variable, depending upon OBX-3-value type. This field may repeat for multipart, single answer results.

Representation
This field contains the value of OBX-3-observation identifier of the same segment. Depending upon the observation, the data type may be a number (e.g., a respiratory rate), a coded answer (e.g., a pathology impression recorded as SNOMED), or a date/time (the date/time that a unit of blood is sent to the ward). An observation value is always represented as the data type specified in OBX-2-value type of the same segment. Whether numeric or short text, the answer shall be recorded in ASCII text.

Reporting logically independent observations
The main sections of dictated reports, such as radiologic studies or history and physicals, are reported as separate OBX segments. In addition, each logically independent observation should be reported in a separate OBX segment, i.e., one OBX segment should not contain the result of more than one logically independent observation. This requirement is included to assure that the contents of OBX-6-units, OBX-8-interpretation codes, and OBX-9-probability can be interpreted unambiguously. The electrolytes and vital signs batteries, for example, would each be reported as four separate OBX segments. Two diagnostic impressions, e.g., congestive heart failure and pneumonia, would also be reported as two separate OBX segments whether reported as part of a discharge summary or chest X-ray report. Similarly, two bacterial organisms isolated in a single bacterial culture would be reported as two separate OBX segments.

Though two independent diagnostic statements cannot be reported in one OBX segment, multiple categorical responses are allowed (usually as CWE data types separated by repeat delimiters), so long as they are fragments (modifiers) that together construct one diagnostic statement. Right upper lobe (recorded as one code) and pneumonia (recorded as another code), for example, could be both reported in one OBX segment. Such multiple ""values"" would be separated by repeat delimiters.

Multiple OBX segments with the same observation ID and Sub ID
In some systems, a single observation may include fragments of more than one data type. The most common example is a numeric result followed by coded comments (CWE). In this case, the logical observation can be sent in more than one OBX segment. For example, one segment of numeric or string data type for the numeric result and another segment of CWE data type for coded comments. If the producer was reporting multiple coded comments they would all be sent in one OBX segment separated by repeat delimiters because they all modified a single logical observation. Multiple OBX segments with the same observation ID and sub ID should always be sent in sequence with the most significant OBX segment (the one that has the normal flag/units and or reference range and status flag) first. The value of OBX-6 through 12 should be null in any following OBX segments with the same OBX-3-observation identifier and OBX-4-observation sub-ID. For the purpose of replacement or deletion, multiple OBX segments with the same observation ID and sub ID are treated as a unit. If any are replaced or deleted, they all are replaced.

Coded values
When an OBX segment contains values of CWE data types, the observations are stored as a combination of codes and/or text. In Section 7.7.3, ""CSS - Clinical Study Data Schedule Segment,"" examples of results that are represented as CWE data types are shown in the first and second OBX segments of OBR 1 and the first and second OBX segments of OBR 2. The observation may be an observation battery ID (for recommended studies), a diagnostic code or finding (for a diagnostic impression), or an anatomic site for a pathology report, or any of the other kinds of coded results.

It is not necessary to always encode the information stored within a coded observation. For example, a chest X-ray impression could be transmitted as pure text even though it has a CWE data type. In this case, the test must be recorded as the second component of the result code, e.g.,
OBX|1|CWE|19005^X-Ray Impression^LN|1|^CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.|...<cr>

However, separate impressions, recommendations, etc., even if recorded as pure text, should be recorded in separate result segments. That is, congestive heart failure and pneumonia should not be sent as:
OBX|1|CWE|19005^X-Ray Impression^LN|1|^CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE AND PNEUMONIA|...<cr>

but as:
OBX|1|CWE|19005^X-Ray Impression^LN|1|^CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE|...<cr>
OBX|2|CWE|19005^X-Ray Impression^LN|2|^PNEUMONIA|....<cr>

Even better would be fully-coded results that include computer understandable codes (component 1) instead of, or in addition to, the text description (component 2). One may include multiple values in a CWE value and these can be mixtures of code and text, but only when they are needed to construct one diagnosis, impression, or concept. When text follows codes as an independent value it would be taken as a modifier or addenda to the codes. E.g.,
OBX|1|CWE|19005-8^X-ray impression^LN~29548-5^DiagnosisImpPatient^LN |1|428.0^CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE^I9C~^MASSIVE HEART|...<cr>

The text in component 2 should be an accurate description of the code in component 1. Likewise, if used, the text in component 5 should be an accurate description of the code in component 4.

CDA documents are to be exchanged in the OBX segment. The value of OBX-2-Value Type should be set to 'ED'. OBX-5-Observation Value contains the MIME package encoded as an encapsulated data type. The components should be valued as follows:
- Set the value of OBX-5.2-Type of Data to 'multipart.'
- Set the value of OBX-5.3-Data Subtype to '-hl7-cda-level-one.'
- Set the value of OBX-5.4-Encoding to 'A'. (Note that a MIME package is not itself Base64-encoded. Rather entities within the MIME package are Base64-encoded. A MIME package is sent as ASCII text. Therefore, the correct value is 'A' not 'Base64.'
- Set the value of OBX-5.5-Data to equal the MIME package. Every entity within the MIME package must be Base64-encoded. As stated in Chapter 2, ""the data component must be scanned before transmission for HL7 delimiter characters (and other non-printing ASCII or non-ASCII characters such as LineFeed), and any found must be escaped by using the HL7 escape sequences defined in Section 2.7 'Use of escape sequences in text fields.' On the receiving application, the data field must be de-escaped after being parsed."" As a result, CR/LF sequences required in the MIME package need to be escaped (i.e., converted to '\X0D0A\') prior to transmission. The content type of the first MIME entity is set to 'application/x-hl7-cda-level-one+xml', and should contain the CDA document itself. Multimedia objects referenced by the CDA document that need to be transmitted within the CDA document are to be placed in successive entities of the MIME package.",

As a CWE data type, this field may be populated with either HL7-defined codes or codes derived from other code systems (such as SNOMED).

When the filler can discern the normal status of a textual report, such as chest X-ray reports or microbiologic culture, these should be reported as ""N"" when normal and ""A""when abnormal. Multiple codes, e.g., abnormal and worse, would be separated by a repeat delimiter, e.g., ""A~W"".

Results may also be reported in shorthand by reporting the normalcy status without specifying the exact numeric value of the result. Such shorthand is quite common in clinical notes, where physicians will simply say that the glucose result was normal. Such shorthand reporting is also seen in drug experience reporting. In such cases, the result can be reported in the OBX by reporting the interpretation code in OBX-8-Interpretation Codes without specifying any value in OBX-5-observation value.",

It is a required field. Previous versions of HL7 stated this implicitly by defining a default value of ""F."" Code F indicates that the result has been verified to be correct and final. Code W indicates that the result has been verified to be wrong (incorrect); a replacement (corrected) result may be transmitted later. Code C indicates that data contained in the OBX-5-observation value field are to replace previously transmitted (verified and) final result data with the same observation ID (including suffix, if applicable) and observation sub-ID usually because the previous results were wrong. Code D indicates that data previously transmitted in a result segment with the same observation ID (including suffix) and observation sub-ID should be deleted. When changing or deleting a result, multiple OBX segments with the same observation ID and observation sub-ID are replaced or deleted as a unit. Normal progression of results through intermediate (e.g., ‘gram positive cocci’) to final (e.g., ‘staphylococcus aureus’) should not be transmitted as C (correction); they should be transmitted as P (depending upon the specific case) until they are final.

If an observation involves multiple OBX segments with the same observation ID (including suffix) and observation sub-ID, the observation result status applies to all OBX segments, except where the value is D or X. The value of D or X is applicable only to the individual OBX. All other OBX segments with the same Observation ID and observation sub-ID must have the same value.

In the case of coding systems such as LOINC, the preceding rules typically mean that this field applies to a single OBX segment.

There are situations where the observation battery required for the order needs to be dynamically specified at the time of ordering. That is, this battery is then defined by the set of OBX segments transmitted along with the order and generated by the placing system. For example, timed measurements of serum glucose challenge tests may vary among laboratories. One institution may report them at –30, -15, 0, 30, 60, and 120 minutes, while another may report them at –30, 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes. Master file entries may exist for each individual element of the battery but not for the battery itself. Another example may be Renin Studies where the specification may be done upon ordering without having a master file definition for each permutation of the possible element. The OBX segments in the ORM message can be used to create dynamic specifications to accommodate these permutations without defining pre-existing master file definitions for the battery itself. The result status field in the OBX can be used to indicate whether the OBX in the ORM message is used to provide a dynamic specification or is used to communicate a result as context to the order. The status of O shall be used to indicate that the OBX segment is used for a dynamic specification of the required result. An OBX used for a dynamic specification must contain the detaile",

The date of these observations is important to the filler laboratories.

In all cases, the observation date-time is the physiologically relevant date-time or the closest approximation to that date-time. In the case of tests performed on specimens, the relevant date-time is the specimen’s collection date-time.

As of v2.7, the Assigning Authority is conditional. It is required if XCN.1 is populated and neither XCN.22 nor XCN.23 are populated. All 3 components may be populated. No assumptions can be safely made based on position or sequence. Best practice is to send an OID in this component when populated.

The reader is referred to XCN.22 and XCN.23 if there is a need to transmit values with semantic meaning for an assigning jurisdiction or assigning department or agency in addition to, or instead of, an assigning authority. However, all 3 components may be valued.  If, in so doing, it is discovered that the values in XCN.22 and/or XCN.23 conflict with XCN.9, the user would look to the Message Profile or other implementation agreement for a statement as to which takes precedence.
Note: When the HD data type is used in a given segment as a component of a field of another data type, User-defined Table 0300 - Namespace ID (referenced by the first sub-component of the HD component) may be re-defined (given a different user-defined table number and name) by the technical committee responsible for that segment.

This component provides only hints for the receiver, so it can make choices regarding what it has been sent and what it is capable of displaying.",

When an HL7 table is used for a CNE data type, the name of coding system component is defined as HL7nnnn where nnnn is the HL7 table number. Similarly, ISO tables will be named ISOnnnn, where nnnn is the ISO table number.

Usage Note: The following statement is retained for backward compatibility as of v2.7. Best practice would recommend that this component always be populated. However, if the field narrative explicitly states ""Refer to HL7 Table nnnn for valid values”, and, if the sending and receiving systems are HL7 compliant, the coding system would be known from the standard.  This would be similar to a field with an ID data type, except that there is a second triplet in which to express an alternate code.",
