It is understood that the ""called by"" name is not part of the full name. Where a nickname has more parts, possibly including a family name, a different XPN with a type of nickname should instead be used.
Examples:
 - James Robert Smith is Called By Jim Bob
 - James Robert Smith is Called By JR
 - Peter Richard Smith is Called By Richard

If version ID is absent, it will be interpreted to have the same value as the HL7 version number in the message header. ",
