 As of v2.7 this component is required when CNE.1 is populated and CNE.14 is not populated. Both CNE.3 and CNE.14 may be populated. Receivers should not identify a code based on its position within the tuples (Identifier, Alternate Identifier, or Second Alternate Identifier) or position within a repeating field. Instead, the receiver should always examine the codingSystem as specified in CNE.3 and/or CNE.14 the Coding System component or the Coding System OID for the tuple.The combination of the identifier and name of coding system represent a unique concept for a data item.

Some organizations that publish code sets author more than one. The coding system, then, to be unique, is a concatenation of the name of the coding authority organization and the name of its code set or table. When an HL7 table is used for a CNE data type, the name of coding system component is defined as HL7nnnn where nnnn is the HL7 table number. Similarly, ISO tables will be named ISOnnnn, where nnnn is the ISO table number.

Usage Note: The following statement is retained for backward compatibility as of v2.7. Best practice would recommend that this component always be populated. However, if the field narrative explicitly states ""Refer to HL7 Table nnnn for valid values”, and, if the sending and receiving systems are HL7 compliant, the coding system would be known from the standard.

 As of v2.7 this component is required when CNE.1 is populated and CNE.14 is not populated. Both CNE.3 and CNE.14 may be populated. Receivers should not identify a code based on its position within the tuples (Identifier, Alternate Identifier, or Second Alternate Identifier) or position within a repeating field. Instead, the receiver should always examine the codingSystem as specified in CNE.3 and/or CNE.14 the Coding System component or the Coding System OID for the tuple.The combination of the identifier and name of coding system represent a unique concept for a data item.

Some organizations that publish code sets author more than one. The coding system, then, to be unique, is a concatenation of the name of the coding authority organization and the name of its code set or table. When an HL7 table is used for a CNE data type, the name of coding system component is defined as HL7nnnn where nnnn is the HL7 table number. Similarly, ISO tables will be named ISOnnnn, where nnnn is the ISO table number.

Usage Note: The following statement is retained for backward compatibility as of v2.7. Best practice would recommend that this component always be populated. However, if the field narrative explicitly states ""Refer to HL7 Table nnnn for valid values”, and, if the sending and receiving systems are HL7 compliant, the coding system would be known from the standard.

 As of v2.7 this component is required when CNE.1 is populated and CNE.14 is not populated. Both CNE.3 and CNE.14 may be populated. Receivers should not identify a code based on its position within the tuples (Identifier, Alternate Identifier, or Second Alternate Identifier) or position within a repeating field. Instead, the receiver should always examine the codingSystem as specified in CNE.3 and/or CNE.14 the Coding System component or the Coding System OID for the tuple.The combination of the identifier and name of coding system represent a unique concept for a data item.

Some organizations that publish code sets author more than one. The coding system, then, to be unique, is a concatenation of the name of the coding authority organization and the name of its code set or table. When an HL7 table is used for a CNE data type, the name of coding system component is defined as HL7nnnn where nnnn is the HL7 table number. Similarly, ISO tables will be named ISOnnnn, where nnnn is the ISO table number.

Usage Note: The following statement is retained for backward compatibility as of v2.7. Best practice would recommend that this component always be populated. However, if the field narrative explicitly states ""Refer to HL7 Table nnnn for valid values”, and, if the sending and receiving systems are HL7 compliant, the coding system would be known from the standard.  This would be similar to a field with an ID data type, except that there is a second triplet in which to express an alternate code.",

 As of v2.7 this component is required when CNE.1 is populated and CNE.14 is not populated. Both CNE.3 and CNE.14 may be populated.

Instead, the receiver should always examine the codingSystem as specified in CNE.3 and/or CNE.14 the Coding System component or the Coding System OID for the tuple.The combination of the identifier and name of coding system represent a unique concept for a data item.

Some organizations that publish code sets author more than one. The coding system, then, to be unique, is a concatenation of the name of the coding authority organization and the name of its code set or table. When an HL7 table is used for a CNE data type, the name of coding system component is defined as HL7nnnn where nnnn is the HL7 table number. Similarly, ISO tables will be named ISOnnnn, where nnnn is the ISO table number.

Usage Note: The following statement is retained for backward compatibility as of v2.7. Best practice would recommend that this component always be populated. However, if the field narrative explicitly states ""Refer to HL7 Table nnnn for valid values”, and, if the sending and receiving systems are HL7 compliant, the coding system would be known from the standard.

Receivers should not identify a code based on its position within the tuples (Identifier, Alternate Identifier, or Second Alternate Identifier) or position within a repeating field. Instead, the receiver should always examine the codingSystem as specified in CNE.3 and/or CNE.14 the Coding System component or the Coding System OID for the tuple.The combination of the identifier and name of coding system represent a unique concept for a data item.

Some organizations that publish code sets author more than one. The coding system, then, to be unique, is a concatenation of the name of the coding authority organization and the name of its code set or table. When an HL7 table is used for a CNE data type, the name of coding system component is defined as HL7nnnn where nnnn is the HL7 table number. Similarly, ISO tables will be named ISOnnnn, where nnnn is the ISO table number.

Usage Note: The following statement is retained for backward compatibility as of v2.7. Best practice would recommend that this component always be populated. However, if the field narrative explicitly states ""Refer to HL7 Table nnnn for valid values”, and, if the sending and receiving systems are HL7 compliant, the coding system would be known from the standard.  This would be similar to a field with an ID data type, except that there is a second triplet in which to express an alternate code.",

 As of v2.7 this component is required when CNE.1 is populated and CNE.14 is not populated. Both CNE.3 and CNE.14 may be populated. Receivers should not identify a code based on its position within the tuples (Identifier, Alternate Identifier, or Second Alternate Identifier) or position within a repeating field. Instead, the receiver should always examine the codingSystem as specified in CNE.3 and/or CNE.14 the Coding System component or the Coding System OID for the tuple.The combination of the identifier and name of coding system represent a unique concept for a data item.

Some organizations that publish code sets author more than one. The coding system, then, to be unique, is a concatenation of the name of the coding authority organization and the name of its code set or table. When an HL7 table is used for a CNE data type, the name of coding system component is defined as HL7nnnn where nnnn is the HL7 table number. Similarly, ISO tables will be named ISOnnnn, where nnnn is the ISO table number.

Usage Note: The following statement is retained for backward compatibility as of v2.7. Best practice would recommend that this component always be populated. However, if the field narrative explicitly states ""Refer to HL7 Table nnnn for valid values”, and, if the sending and receiving systems are HL7 compliant, the coding system would be known from the standard.  This would be similar to a field with an ID data type, except that there is a second triplet in which to express an alternate code.",

 As of v2.7 this component is required when CNE.1 is populated and CNE.14 is not populated. Both CNE.3 and CNE.14 may be populated. Receivers should not identify a code based on its position within the tuples (Identifier, Alternate Identifier, or Second Alternate Identifier) or position within a repeating field. Instead, the receiver should always examine the codingSystem as specified in CNE.3 and/or CNE.14 the Coding System component or the Coding System OID for the tuple.The combination of the identifier and name of coding system represent a unique concept for a data item.

Some organizations that publish code sets author more than one. The coding system, then, to be unique, is a concatenation of the name of the coding authority organization and the name of its code set or table. When an HL7 table is used for a CNE data type, the name of coding system component is defined as HL7nnnn where nnnn is the HL7 table number. Similarly, ISO tables will be named ISOnnnn, where nnnn is the ISO table number.

Usage Note: The following statement is retained for backward compatibility as of v2.7. Best practice would recommend that this component always be populated. However, if the field narrative explicitly states ""Refer to HL7 Table nnnn for valid values”, and, if the sending and receiving systems are HL7 compliant, the coding system would be known from the standard.  This would be similar to a field with an ID data type, except that there is a second triplet in which to express an alternate code.",

 As of v2.7 this component is required when CNE.1 is populated and CNE.14 is not populated. Both CNE.3 and CNE.14 may be populated. Receivers should not identify a code based on its position within the tuples (Identifier, Alternate Identifier, or Second Alternate Identifier) or position within a repeating field. Instead, the receiver should always examine the codingSystem as specified in CNE.3 and/or CNE.14 the Coding System component or the Coding System OID for the tuple.The combination of the identifier and name of coding system represent a unique concept for a data item.

Some organizations that publish code sets author more than one. The coding system, then, to be unique, is a concatenation of the name of the coding authority organization and the name of its code set or table. When an HL7 table is used for a CNE data type, the name of coding system component is defined as HL7nnnn where nnnn is the HL7 table number. Similarly, ISO tables will be named ISOnnnn, where nnnn is the ISO table number.

Usage Note: The following statement is retained for backward compatibility as of v2.7. Best practice would recommend that this component always be populated. However, if the field narrative explicitly states ""Refer to HL7 Table nnnn for valid values”, and, if the sending and receiving systems are HL7 compliant, the coding system would be known from the standard.

 As of v2.7 this component is required when CNE.1 is populated and CNE.14 is not populated. Both CNE.3 and CNE.14 may be populated. Receivers should not identify a code based on its position within the tuples (Identifier, Alternate Identifier, or Second Alternate Identifier) or position within a repeating field. Instead, the receiver should always examine the codingSystem as specified in CNE.3 and/or CNE.14 the Coding System component or the Coding System OID for the tuple.The combination of the identifier and name of coding system represent a unique concept for a data item.

Some organizations that publish code sets author more than one. The coding system, then, to be unique, is a concatenation of the name of the coding authority organization and the name of its code set or table. When an HL7 table is used for a CNE data type, the name of coding system component is defined as HL7nnnn where nnnn is the HL7 table number. Similarly, ISO tables will be named ISOnnnn, where nnnn is the ISO table number.

Usage Note: The following statement is retained for backward compatibility as of v2.7. Best practice would recommend that this component always be populated. However, if the field narrative explicitly states ""Refer to HL7 Table nnnn for valid values”, and, if the sending and receiving systems are HL7 compliant, the coding system would be known from the standard.

 As of v2.7 this component is required when CNE.1 is populated and CNE.14 is not populated. Both CNE.3 and CNE.14 may be populated. Receivers should not identify a code based on its position within the tuples (Identifier, Alternate Identifier, or Second Alternate Identifier) or position within a repeating field. Instead, the receiver should always examine the codingSystem as specified in CNE.3 and/or CNE.14 the Coding System component or the Coding System OID for the tuple.The combination of the identifier and name of coding system represent a unique concept for a data item.

Some organizations that publish code sets author more than one. The coding system, then, to be unique, is a concatenation of the name of the coding authority organization and the name of its code set or table. When an HL7 table is used for a CNE data type, the name of coding system component is defined as HL7nnnn where nnnn is the HL7 table number. Similarly, ISO tables will be named ISOnnnn, where nnnn is the ISO table number.

Usage Note: The following statement is retained for backward compatibility as of v2.7. Best practice would recommend that this component always be populated. However, if the field narrative explicitly states ""Refer to HL7 Table nnnn for valid values”, and, if the sending and receiving systems are HL7 compliant, the coding system would be known from the standard.
