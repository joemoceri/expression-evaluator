Each coding system is assigned a unique identifier. As of v2.7 this component is required when CWE.1 is populated and CWE.14 is not populated. Both CWE.3 and CWE.14 may be populated. Receivers should not identify a code based on its position within the tuples (Identifier, Alternate Identifier, or Second Alternate Identifier) or position within a repeating field. Instead, the receiver should always examine the codingSystem as specified in CWE.3 and/or CWE.14, the ""Coding System"" component or the ""Coding System OID"" for the tuple.

Refer to HL7 Table 0396 – Coding System in Chapter 2C, section ""Coding System Table"" for valid values. 

Refer to section 2.A.8.3, ""Name of Coding System (ID)"" for a discussion of coding system conventions.",
