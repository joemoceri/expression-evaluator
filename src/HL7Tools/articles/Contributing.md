## Contributing
Right now it's just me. If you could follow this flow, that would make it easier to keep track of changes. Contributions should be handled with the following git workflow.

1) Fork the repo on GitHub
2) Clone the project to your machine
3) Commit changes to your branch
4) Push your work back up to your fork
5) Submit a pull request so that your changes can be reviewed
