{"id":"PID","segmentId":"PID","longName":"Patient Identification","description":"The PID segment is used by all applications as the primary means of communicating patient identification information.  This segment contains permanent patient identifying and demographic information that, for the most part, is not likely to change frequently.\r\n\r\nUsage notes:  PID patient identification \r\nThe assigning facility ID, the fourth component of the patient identifiers, is a string of up to six characters that is uniquely associated with the facility that originally assigned the number.  A given institution, or group of intercommunicating institutions, should establish a list of facilities that may be potential assignors of patient identification (and other important identification) numbers.  The list will be one of the institutionâ€™s master dictionary lists.  Since third parties (other than the assignors of patient identification numbers) may send or receive HL7 messages containing patient identification numbers, the assigning facility ID in the patient identification numbers may not be the same as the sending and receiving systems identified in the MSH.  The assigning facility ID must be unique across applications at a given site.  This field is required in HL7 implementations that have more than a single Patient Administration application assigning such numbers.
