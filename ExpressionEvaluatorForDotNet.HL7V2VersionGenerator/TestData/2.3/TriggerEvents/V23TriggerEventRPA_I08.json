The specific medical procedures must be filled out in the PR1 segments.  Each repeating PR1 segment may be paired with an AUT segment so that authorization information can be given regarding dollar amounts, number of treatments, and perhaps the estimated length of stay for treatment.  The OBR and OBX segments should be used to include any relevant clinical information that may be required to support or process the authorization.
