{"id":"ADT_A28","msgStructId":"ADT_A28","eventDesc":"Add person information","description":"The A28 event can be used to send everything that is known about a person.  For example, it can be sent to an ICU unit (in addition to the A02 (transfer a patient) event) when a patient is transferred to the ICU unit in order to backload all demographic information for the patient into the ICU system.  An A28 (add person information) or A31 (update person information) can also be used for backloading MPI information for the person, or for backloading person and historical information.\r\n\r\nThese events should not replace the use of the A01 (admit/visit notification, A03 (discharge/end visit), A04 (register a patient), A08 (update patient information), etc., events.  They are not intended to be used for notification of real-time Patient Administration events.  Visit information may be included but is not required.  These events are primarily for demographic data, but optional historical non-demographic data may be sent as well.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_03"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","segmentId":null,"longName":"Message header segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"EVN","segmentId":null,"longName":"Event type","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"2","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PID","segmentId":null,"longName":"Patient Identification","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"3","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PD1","segmentId":null,"longName":"Patient Demographic","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"4","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NK1","segmentId":null,"longName":"Next of kin","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"5","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PV1","segmentId":null,"longName":"Patient visit","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"6","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PV2","segmentId":null,"longName":"Patient visit - additional information","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"7","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"DB1","segmentId":null,"longName":"Disability Segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"8","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"OBX","segmentId":null,"longName":"Observation segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"9","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"AL1","segmentId":null,"longName":"Patient Allergy Information","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"10","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"DG1","segmentId":null,"longName":"Diagnosis","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"11","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"DRG","segmentId":null,"longName":"Diagnosis Related Group","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"12","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"segmentId":null,"longName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"PR1","segmentId":null,"longName":"Procedures","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"13","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"ROL","segmentId":null,"longName":"Role","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"14","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":"GT1","segmentId":null,"longName":"Guarantor","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"15","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"segmentId":null,"longName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"IN1","segmentId":null,"longName":"Insurance","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"16","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"IN2","segmentId":null,"longName":"Insurance additional info","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"17","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"IN3","segmentId":null,"longName":"Insurance additional info - certification","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"18","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":"ACC","segmentId":null,"longName":"Accident","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"19","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"UB1","segmentId":null,"longName":"UB82  data","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"20","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"UB2","segmentId":null,"longName":"UB92 data","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"21","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}
