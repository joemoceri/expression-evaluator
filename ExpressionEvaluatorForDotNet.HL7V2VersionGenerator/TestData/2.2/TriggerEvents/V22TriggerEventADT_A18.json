{"id":"ADT_A18","msgStructId":"ADT_A18","eventDesc":"Merge Patient Information","description":"Used to merge current and previous patient identification numbers:  patient ID - internal, patient ID - external, alternate patient ID and patient account number.  This is required, for example, when a patient has previously been registered under a new patient identification number because of an error or because there was insufficient time to determine the actual patient identification number.  The merge event occurs when the decision is made to combine the information under either the new or old identifier(s).  It is recommended that events A34, A35 and A36 be utilized in place of the A18 event whenever possible.  [Event A18 is being kept for backwards compatibility.]\r\n\r\nThe PID segment contains the surviving patient ID information.  The MRG segment contains the non-surviving information.
