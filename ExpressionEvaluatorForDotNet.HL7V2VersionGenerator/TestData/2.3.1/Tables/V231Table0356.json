This standard specifies an escape sequence from basic one byte character set to specified other character set, and vice versa.  The escape sequence explicitly specifies what alternate character set to be evoked. Note that in this mode, the actual ASCII escape character is used as defined in the referenced ISO document. As noted in 1.6.1., escape sequences to/from alternate character set should occur within HL7 delimiters. In other words, HL7 delimiters are basic one byte characters only, and just before and just after delimiters, character encoding status should be the basic one byte set.","comment":null}]}
