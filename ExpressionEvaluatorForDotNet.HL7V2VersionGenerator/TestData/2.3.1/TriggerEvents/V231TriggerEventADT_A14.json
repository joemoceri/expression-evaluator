{"id":"ADT_A14","msgStructId":"ADT_A14","eventDesc":"Pending admit","description":"An A14 event notifies other systems of a planned admission, when there is a reservation or when patient admission is to occur imminently.  The A14 event is similar to a pre-admit, but without the implication that an account should be opened for the purposes of tests prior to admission.  It is used when advanced notification of an admit is required in order to prepare for the patientâ€™s arrival.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_03"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","segmentId":null,"longName":"Message header segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"EVN","segmentId":null,"longName":"Event type segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"2","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PID","segmentId":null,"longName":"Patient identification segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"3","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PD1","segmentId":null,"longName":"Patient Additional Demographic","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"4","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NK1","segmentId":null,"longName":"Next of kin / associated parties segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"5","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PV1","segmentId":null,"longName":"Patient visit segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"6","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PV2","segmentId":null,"longName":"Patient visit - additional information segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"7","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"DB1","segmentId":null,"longName":"Disability segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"8","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"OBX","segmentId":null,"longName":"Observation/result segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"9","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"AL1","segmentId":null,"longName":"Patient allergy information segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"10","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"DG1","segmentId":null,"longName":"Diagnosis segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"11","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"DRG","segmentId":null,"longName":"Diagnosis related group segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"12","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"segmentId":null,"longName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"PR1","segmentId":null,"longName":"Procedures segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"13","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"ROL","segmentId":null,"longName":"Role","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"14","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":"GT1","segmentId":null,"longName":"Guarantor segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"15","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"segmentId":null,"longName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"IN1","segmentId":null,"longName":"Insurance segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"16","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"IN2","segmentId":null,"longName":"Insurance additional information segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"17","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"IN3","segmentId":null,"longName":"Insurance additional information, certification segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"18","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":"ACC","segmentId":null,"longName":"Accident segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"19","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"UB1","segmentId":null,"longName":"UB82 data segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"20","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"UB2","segmentId":null,"longName":"UB92 data segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"21","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}
