{"id":"ADT_A18","msgStructId":"ADT_A18","eventDesc":"Merge patient information","description":"Event A18 is being retained for backward compatibility.  The A18 event is used to merge current and previous patient identification numbers: PID-3-patient identifier list, PID-2-patient ID, PID-4-alternate patient ID-PID, and PID-18-patient account number.  This procedure is required, for example, when a previous patient is registered under a new patient identification number because of an error, or because there was insufficient time to determine the actual patient identification number.  The merge event occurs when a decision is made to combine the information under either the new or the old identifier(s).  We recommend that events A34 (merge patient information-patient ID only), A35 (merge patient information-account number only), A36 (merge patient information-patient ID & account number), A39 (merge person-patient ID), A40 (merge patient-patient identifier list), A41 (merge account-patient account number), and A42 (merge visitvisit number) be utilized in place of the A18 event whenever possible.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_03"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","segmentId":null,"longName":"Message header segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"EVN","segmentId":null,"longName":"Event type segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"2","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PID","segmentId":null,"longName":"Patient identification segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"3","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PD1","segmentId":null,"longName":"Patient Additional Demographic","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"4","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"MRG","segmentId":null,"longName":"Merge patient information segment-","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"5","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PV1","segmentId":null,"longName":"Patient visit segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"6","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}
