Event A47 (change patient identifier list) should be used instead. A change has been done at the external identifier level.  That is, a PID-2-patient ID has been found to be incorrect and has been changed.\r\n\r\nAn A46 event is used to signal a change of an incorrectly assigned PID-2-patient ID value.
