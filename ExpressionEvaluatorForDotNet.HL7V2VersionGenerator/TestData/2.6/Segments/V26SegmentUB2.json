{"id":"UB2","segmentId":"UB2","longName":"UB92 Data","description":"The UB2 segment contains data necessary to complete UB92 bills specific to the United States; other realms may choose to implement using regional code sets. Only UB92 fields that do not exist in other HL7 defined segments appear in this segment.  For example, Patient Name and Date of Birth are required; they are included in the PID segment and therefore do not appear here. UB92 field locators are provided in parentheses ( ). The UB codes listed as examples are not an exhaustive or current list; refer to a UB specification for additional information.","sample":"","chapters":["CH_06"],"fields":[{"id":"UB2.1","type":"Field","position":"UB2.1","name":"Set ID - UB2","length":4,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"SI","dataTypeName":"Sequence ID","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"UB2.2","type":"Field","position":"UB2.2","name":"Co-Insurance Days","length":3,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"UB2.3","type":"Field","position":"UB2.3","name":"Condition Code","length":2,"usage":"O","rpt":"7","dataType":"IS","dataTypeName":"Coded value for user-defined tables","tableId":"0043","tableName":"Condition Code","description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"UB2.4","type":"Field","position":"UB2.4","name":"Covered Days","length":3,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"UB2.5","type":"Field","position":"UB2.5","name":"Non-Covered Days","length":4,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"UB2.6","type":"Field","position":"UB2.6","name":"Value Amount and Code","length":41,"usage":"O","rpt":"12","dataType":"UVC","dataTypeName":"UB Value Code and Amount","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"UB2.7","type":"Field","position":"UB2.7","name":"Occurrence Code and Date","length":259,"usage":"O","rpt":"8","dataType":"OCD","dataTypeName":"Occurrence Code and Date","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"UB2.8","type":"Field","position":"UB2.8","name":"Occurrence Span Code/Dates","length":268,"usage":"O","rpt":"2","dataType":"OSP","dataTypeName":"Occurrence Span Code and Date","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"UB2.9","type":"Field","position":"UB2.9","name":"UB92 Locator 2 (State)","length":29,"usage":"O","rpt":"2","dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"UB2.10","type":"Field","position":"UB2.10","name":"UB92 Locator 11 (State)","length":12,"usage":"O","rpt":"2","dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"UB2.11","type":"Field","position":"UB2.11","name":"UB92 Locator 31 (National)","length":5,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"UB2.12","type":"Field","position":"UB2.12","name":"Document Control Number","length":23,"usage":"O","rpt":"3","dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"UB2.13","type":"Field","position":"UB2.13","name":"UB92 Locator 49 (National)","length":4,"usage":"O","rpt":"23","dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"UB2.14","type":"Field","position":"UB2.14","name":"UB92 Locator 56 (State)","length":14,"usage":"O","rpt":"5","dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"UB2.15","type":"Field","position":"UB2.15","name":"UB92 Locator 57 (National)","length":27,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"UB2.16","type":"Field","position":"UB2.16","name":"UB92 Locator 78 (State)","length":2,"usage":"O","rpt":"2","dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"UB2.17","type":"Field","position":"UB2.17","name":"Special Visit Count","length":3,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"NM","dataTypeName":"Numeric","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null}],"sequence":null,"usage":null,"rpt":null,"isGroup":false,"segments":null}
