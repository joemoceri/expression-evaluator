{"id":"TQ1","segmentId":"TQ1","longName":"Timing/Quantity","description":"The TQ1 segment is used to specify the complex timing of events and actions such as those that occur in order management and scheduling systems. This segment determines the quantity, frequency, priority and timing of a service. By allowing the segment to repeat, it is possible to have service requests that vary the quantity, frequency and priority of a service request over time.","sample":"","chapters":["CH_04"],"fields":[{"id":"TQ1.1","type":"Field","position":"TQ1.1","name":"Set ID - TQ1","length":4,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"SI","dataTypeName":"Sequence ID","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"TQ1.2","type":"Field","position":"TQ1.2","name":"Quantity","length":20,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"CQ","dataTypeName":"Composite Quantity with Units","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"TQ1.3","type":"Field","position":"TQ1.3","name":"Repeat Pattern","length":540,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","dataType":"RPT","dataTypeName":"Repeat Pattern","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"TQ1.4","type":"Field","position":"TQ1.4","name":"Explicit Time","length":20,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","dataType":"TM","dataTypeName":"Time","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"TQ1.5","type":"Field","position":"TQ1.5","name":"Relative Time and Units","length":20,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","dataType":"CQ","dataTypeName":"Composite Quantity with Units","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"TQ1.6","type":"Field","position":"TQ1.6","name":"Service Duration","length":20,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"CQ","dataTypeName":"Composite Quantity with Units","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"TQ1.7","type":"Field","position":"TQ1.7","name":"Start date/time","length":24,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"DTM","dataTypeName":"Date/Time","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"TQ1.8","type":"Field","position":"TQ1.8","name":"End date/time","length":24,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"DTM","dataTypeName":"Date/Time","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"TQ1.9","type":"Field","position":"TQ1.9","name":"Priority","length":250,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded with Exceptions","tableId":"0485","tableName":"Extended Priority Codes","description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"TQ1.10","type":"Field","position":"TQ1.10","name":"Condition text","length":250,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"TX","dataTypeName":"Text Data","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"TQ1.11","type":"Field","position":"TQ1.11","name":"Text instruction","length":250,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"TX","dataTypeName":"Text Data","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"TQ1.12","type":"Field","position":"TQ1.12","name":"Conjunction","length":10,"usage":"C","rpt":"1","dataType":"ID","dataTypeName":"Coded values for HL7 tables","tableId":"0472","tableName":"TQ conjunction ID","description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"TQ1.13","type":"Field","position":"TQ1.13","name":"Occurrence duration","length":20,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"CQ","dataTypeName":"Composite Quantity with Units","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"TQ1.14","type":"Field","position":"TQ1.14","name":"Total occurrences","length":10,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"NM","dataTypeName":"Numeric","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null}],"sequence":null,"usage":null,"rpt":null,"isGroup":false,"segments":null}
