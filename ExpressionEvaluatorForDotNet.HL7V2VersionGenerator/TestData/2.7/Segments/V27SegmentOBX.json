{"id":"OBX","segmentId":"OBX","longName":"Observation/result","description":"The OBX segment is used to transmit a single observation or observation fragment. It represents the smallest indivisible unit of a report. The OBX segment can also contain encapsulated data, e.g., a CDA document or a DICOM image.\r\n\r\nIts principal mission is to carry information about observations in report messages. But the OBX can also be part of an observation order (see Chapter 4, section 4.4, \"General Trigger Events & Message Definitions\"). In this case, the OBX carries clinical information needed by the filler to interpret the observation the filler makes. For example, an OBX is needed to report the inspired oxygen on an order for a blood oxygen to a blood gas lab, or to report the menstrual phase information which should be included on an order for a pap smear to a cytology lab. Appendix 7A includes codes for identifying many of pieces of information needed by observation producing services to properly interpret a test result. OBX is also found in other HL7 messages that need to include patient clinical information.\r\n\r\nWhen using the OBX for the TIM category, OBX-2 Value Type should be valued to DTM. Consequently, OBX-5 Observation Value should have a length of 26 given the format of the DTM data type. Note the expectations on which fields are required as well as the fields that should not be valued.\r\n\r\nWhen using the OBX for the CHN category, OBX-2 Value Type should be valued to CD. Consequently, OBX-5 Observation Value could have a length of up to 65536 given the format of the CD data type. Note the expectations on which fields are required as well as the fields that should not be valued.\r\n\r\nWhen using the OBX for the WAV category, OBX-2 can be valued as either NA or MA. The length of OBX-5 Observation Value depends on the data type chosen. NA is a repeating data type, and the length will depend on the number of repeats. Note the expectations on which fields are required as well as the fields that should not be valued.\r\n\r\nWhen using the OBX for the ANO category, OBX-2 Value Type should be valued to CWE. Consequently, OBX-5 Observation Value could have a length of up the 65536 given the format of the data types. Note the expectations on which fields are required as well as the fields that should not be valued.","sample":"","chapters":["CH_07"],"fields":[{"id":"OBX.1","type":"Field","position":"OBX.1","name":"Set Id - Obx","length":4,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"SI","dataTypeName":"Sequence
