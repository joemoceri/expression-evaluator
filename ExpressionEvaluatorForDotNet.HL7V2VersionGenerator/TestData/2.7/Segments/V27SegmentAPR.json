{"id":"APR","segmentId":"APR","longName":"Appointment Preferences","description":"The APR segment contains parameters and preference specifications used for requesting appointments in the SRM message.  It allows placer applications to provide coded parameters and preference indicators to the filler application, to help determine when a requested appointment should be scheduled.  An APR segment can be provided in conjunction with either the ARQ segment or any of the service and resource segments (AIG, AIS, AIP, and AIL).  If an APR segment appears in conjunction with an ARQ segment, its parameters and preference indicators pertain to the schedule request as a whole.  If the APR segment appears with any of the service and resource segments, then its parameters and preferences apply only to the immediately preceding service or resource.","sample":"","chapters":["CH_10"],"fields":[{"id":"APR.1","type":"Field","position":"APR.1","name":"Time Selection Criteria","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","dataType":"SCV","dataTypeName":"Scheduling Class Value Pair","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"APR.2","type":"Field","position":"APR.2","name":"Resource Selection Criteria","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","dataType":"SCV","dataTypeName":"Scheduling Class Value Pair","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"APR.3","type":"Field","position":"APR.3","name":"Location Selection Criteria","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","dataType":"SCV","dataTypeName":"Scheduling Class Value Pair","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"APR.4","type":"Field","position":"APR.4","name":"Slot Spacing Criteria","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"NM","dataTypeName":"Numeric","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"APR.5","type":"Field","position":"APR.5","name":"Filler Override Criteria","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","dataType":"SCV","dataTypeName":"Scheduling Class Value Pair","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null}],"sequence":null,"usage":null,"rpt":null,"isGroup":false,"segments":null}
