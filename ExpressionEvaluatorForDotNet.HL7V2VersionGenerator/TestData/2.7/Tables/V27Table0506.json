An example would be: Phenergan 25 mg PO, IM or R q6h prn (orally, intramuscularly, or rectally every 6 hours as needed)."},{"value":"N","description":"Nurse prerogative","comment":"Where a set of two or more orders exist and the Nurse, or other caregiver, has the prerogative to choose which order will be administered at a particular point in time."},{"value":"S","description":"Simultaneous","comment":"simultaneous order is 2 or more drugs which are ordered to be given at the same time.
