{"id":"OML_O21","msgStructId":"OML_O21","eventDesc":"Laboratory order","description":"The following message structure may be used for the communication of laboratory and other order messages and must be used for lab automation messages where it is required that the Specimen/Container information is within the ORC/OBR segment group.\r\n\r\nThe trigger event for this message is any change to a laboratory order. Such changes include submission of new orders, cancellations, updates, etc. OML messages can originate also with a placer, filler, or an interested third party.\r\n\r\nNote: The additional patient information, which is sent after the OBR with the current order (the segments PID, PD1, PV1, PV2, etc, indicated below with words \"previous result\"), could have been transferred with the previous result because the patient demographics related to the previous result can differ from the demographics related to the current order. The current intent is to only allow references to the same patient as in the header PID.\r\n\r\nThe SAC segments included in the message allow the transfer of, e.g., a laboratory order with multiple containers and multiple test orders related to each container, or laboratory orders with test order requiring multiple containers.\r\n\r\nRefer to Chapter 13, \"Laboratory Automation\" for examples of usage, particularly to clarify the use of two references to SAC segments in this one message.\r\n\r\nThe CTD segment in this trigger is used to transmit temporary patient contact details specific to this order.\r\n\r\nIn relationship to triggers O21, O33, O35, and Oxx this message/trigger (O21) should be used where an order with multiple samples and optionally multiple containers per order item are to be communicated, but not against a complete specimen shipment (O39)","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_04"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","segmentId":null,"longName":"Message
