Order messages must contain accompanying details regarding the blood product component, such as special processing requirements (e.g., irradiation and leukoreduction), and the amount of the blood product to be administered.  Additionally, specific relevant clinical information can be included to allow the prospective review of the appropriateness of the blood product order.\r\n\r\nBlood product orders use the OMB message with the BPO segment for the detail segment and the acknowledgment message, ORB as described below.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_04"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","segmentId":null,"longName":"Message Header","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"MSA","segmentId":null,"longName":"Message Acknowledgment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"2","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"ERR","segmentId":null,"longName":"Error","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"3","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"SFT","segmentId":null,"longName":"Software Segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"4","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"UAC","segmentId":null,"longName":"User Authentication Credential Segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"5","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","segmentId":null,"longName":"Notes And Comments","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"6","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"segmentId":null,"longName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":null,"segmentId":null,"longName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"PID","segmentId":null,"longName":"Patient Identification","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"7","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PRT","segmentId":null,"longName":"Participation Information","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"8","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"ARV","segmentId":null,"longName":"Access Restriction","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"9","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"segmentId":null,"longName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"ORC","segmentId":null,"longName":"Common Order","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"10","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PRT","segmentId":null,"longName":"Participation Information","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"11","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"segmentId":null,"longName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"TQ1","segmentId":null,"longName":"Timing/quantity","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"12","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"TQ2","segmentId":null,"longName":"Timing/quantity Relationship","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"13","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":"BPO","segmentId":null,"longName":"Blood Product Order","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"14","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}]}]}]}
