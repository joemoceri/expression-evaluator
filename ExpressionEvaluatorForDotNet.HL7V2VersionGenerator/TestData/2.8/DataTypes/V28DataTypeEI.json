{"id":"EI","type":"DataType","name":"Entity Identifier","description":"The entity identifier defines a given entity within a specified series of identifiers.\r\n\r\nThe EI is appropriate for, but not limited to, machine or software generated identifiers. The generated identifier goes in the first component. The remaining components, 2 through 4, are known as the assigning authority; they identify the machine/system responsible for generating the identifier in component 1.\r\n\r\nThe specified series, the assigning authority, is defined by components 2 through 4. The assigning authority is of the hierarchic designator (HD) data type, but it is defined as three separate components in the EI data type, rather than as a single component as would normally be the case. This is in order to maintain backward compatibility with the EI’s use as a component in several existing data fields. Otherwise, the components 2 through 4 are as defined in Section 2.A.33, \"HD - hierarchic designator\".
