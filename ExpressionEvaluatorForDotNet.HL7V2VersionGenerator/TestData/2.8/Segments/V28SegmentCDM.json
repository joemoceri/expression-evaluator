{"id":"CDM","segmentId":"CDM","longName":"Charge Description Master","description":"The CDM segment contains the fields for identifying anything which is charged to patient accounts, including procedures, services, supplies.  It is intended to be used to maintain a list of valid chargeable utilization items.  Its purpose is to keep billing codes synchronized between HIS, Patient Accounting, and other departmental systems.  It is not intended to completely support materials management, inventory, or complex pricing structures for which additional complex fields would be required.  Given an identifying charge code, the associated fields in the charge description master file will provide basic pricing and billing data.  All the additional information necessary for patient accounting systems to do billing and claims is not intended to be included in this segment; those should be part of insurance or billing profile tables.  \r\n\r\nThe CDM segment contains the fields which, for one chargeable item, remain the same across facilities, departments, and patient types.  The following PRC segment contains the fields which, for the same chargeable item, vary depending upon facility or department or patient type.","sample":"","chapters":["CH_08"],"fields":[{"id":"CDM.1","type":"Field","position":"CDM.1","name":"Primary Key Value - Cdm","length":0,"usage":"R","rpt":"1","dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","tableId":"0132","tableName":"Transaction Code","description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"CDM.2","type":"Field","position":"CDM.2","name":"Charge Code Alias","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","tableId":"0132","tableName":"Transaction Code","description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"CDM.3","type":"Field","position":"CDM.3","name":"Charge Description Short","length":0,"usage":"R","rpt":"1","dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"CDM.4","type":"Field","position":"CDM.4","name":"Charge Description Long","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"CDM.5","type":"Field","position":"CDM.5","name":"Description Override Indicator","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","tableId":"0268","tableName":"Override","description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"CDM.6","type":"Field","position":"CDM.6","name":"Exploding Charges","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","tableId":"0132","tableName":"Transaction Code","description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"CDM.7","type":"Field","position":"CDM.7","name":"Procedure Code","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","dataType":"CNE","dataTypeName":"Coded With No Exceptions","tableId":"0088","tableName":"Procedure Code","description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"CDM.8","type":"Field","position":"CDM.8","name":"Active/Inactive Flag","length":1,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"ID","dataTypeName":"Coded Value For Hl7 Defined Tables","tableId":"0183","tableName":"Active/Inactive","description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"CDM.9","type":"Field","position":"CDM.9","name":"Inventory Number","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","tableId":"0463","tableName":"Inventory Number","description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"CDM.10","type":"Field","position":"CDM.10","name":"Resource Load","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"NM","dataTypeName":"Numeric","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"CDM.11","type":"Field","position":"CDM.11","name":"Contract Number","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","dataType":"CX","dataTypeName":"Extended Composite Id With Check Digit","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"CDM.12","type":"Field","position":"CDM.12","name":"Contract Organization","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","dataType":"XON","dataTypeName":"Extended Composite Name And Identification Number For Organizations","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"CDM.13","type":"Field","position":"CDM.13","name":"Room Fee Indicator","length":1,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"ID","dataTypeName":"Coded Value For Hl7 Defined Tables","tableId":"0136","tableName":"Yes/no Indicator","description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null}],"sequence":null,"usage":null,"rpt":null,"isGroup":false,"segments":null}
