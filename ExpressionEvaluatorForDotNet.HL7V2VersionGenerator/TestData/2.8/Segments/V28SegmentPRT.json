{"id":"PRT","segmentId":"PRT","longName":"Participation Information","description":"The Participation Information segment contains the data necessary to add, update, correct, and delete from the record persons, organizations, or locations (participants) participating in the activity being transmitted.\r\n\r\nIn general, the PRT segment is used to describe a participant playing a particular role within the context of the message. In OO, for example, in the results messages the PRT segment may be used to provide the performing provider, whether a person or organization. In a specimen shipment message it may be the waypoint location relevant for the shipment.\r\n\r\nThe positional location of the PRT segment indicates the relationship. When the segment is used following the OBX segment, then the participations relate to the relevant participations in the result.","sample":"","chapters":["CH_07"],"fields":[{"id":"PRT.1","type":"Field","position":"PRT.1","name":"Participation Instance Id","length":4,"usage":"C","rpt":"1","dataType":"EI","dataTypeName":"Entity Identifier","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"PRT.2","type":"Field","position":"PRT.2","name":"Action Code","length":2,"usage":"R","rpt":"1","dataType":"ID","dataTypeName":"Coded Value For Hl7 Defined Tables","tableId":"0287","tableName":"Problem/Goal Action Code","description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"PRT.3","type":"Field","position":"PRT.3","name":"Action Reason","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"PRT.4","type":"Field","position":"PRT.4","name":"Participation","length":0,"usage":"R","rpt":"1","dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","tableId":"0912","tableName":"Participation","description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"PRT.5","type":"Field","position":"PRT.5","name":"Participation Person","length":0,"usage":"C","rpt":"*","dataType":"XCN","dataTypeName":"Extended Composite Id Number And Name For Persons","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"PRT.6","type":"Field","position":"PRT.6","name":"Participation Person Provider Type","length":0,"usage":"C","rpt":"1","dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"PRT.7","type":"Field","position":"PRT.7","name":"Participant Organization Unit Type","length":0,"usage":"C","rpt":"1","dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","tableId":"0406","tableName":"Organization Unit Type","description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"PRT.8","type":"Field","position":"PRT.8","name":"Participation Organization","length":0,"usage":"C","rpt":"*","dataType":"XON","dataTypeName":"Extended Composite Name And Identification Number For Organizations","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"PRT.9","type":"Field","position":"PRT.9","name":"Participant Location","length":0,"usage":"C","rpt":"*","dataType":"PL","dataTypeName":"Person Location","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"PRT.10","type":"Field","position":"PRT.10","name":"Participation Device","length":0,"usage":"C","rpt":"*","dataType":"EI","dataTypeName":"Entity Identifier","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"PRT.11","type":"Field","position":"PRT.11","name":"Participation Begin Date/Time (arrival Time)","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"DTM","dataTypeName":"Date/time","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"PRT.12","type":"Field","position":"PRT.12","name":"Participation End Date/Time (departure Time)","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"DTM","dataTypeName":"Date/time","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"PRT.13","type":"Field","position":"PRT.13","name":"Participation Qualitative Duration","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"PRT.14","type":"Field","position":"PRT.14","name":"Participation Address","length":0,"usage":"C","rpt":"*","dataType":"XAD","dataTypeName":"Extended Address","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"PRT.15","type":"Field","position":"PRT.15","name":"Participant Telecommunication Address","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","dataType":"XTN","dataTypeName":"Extended Telecommunication Number","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null}],"sequence":null,"usage":null,"rpt":null,"isGroup":false,"segments":null}
