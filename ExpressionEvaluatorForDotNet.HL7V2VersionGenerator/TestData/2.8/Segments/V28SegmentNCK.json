{"id":"NCK","segmentId":"NCK","longName":"System Clock","description":"The NCK segment is used to allow the various applications on the network to synchronize their system clocks (system date and time).\r\n\r\nUsage Notes: If this message is to be used to automatically reset/correct system clocks, it is recommended that the system or administrative personnel initiating the NMQ with the NCK segment have the authority to correct the clock (system date and time) for the other systems on the network.  This is important in order to avoid the obvious confusion of multiple systems attempting to resynchronize each other's clocks.\r\n\r\nIf this message is used only to gather information on the various systems' clocks, it is still important for an administrative procedure to be worked out to avoid conflicts when resetting clocks.","sample":"","chapters":["CH_14"],"fields":[{"id":"NCK.1","type":"Field","position":"NCK.1","name":"System Date/Time","length":24,"usage":"R","rpt":"1","dataType":"DTM","dataTypeName":"Date/time","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null}],"sequence":null,"usage":null,"rpt":null,"isGroup":false,"segments":null}
