{"id":"REL","segmentId":"REL","longName":"Clinical Relationship Segment","description":"The Clinical Relationship segment contains the data necessary to relate two data elements within and/or external to the message at run-time. It also includes information about the relationship.\r\n\r\nRelationships are constrained to being between explicit segments of messages rather than beween the identities of entities they reference. Segments are available within the message but related persistent information may not be.  Because of the transient nature of messages applications must manage the associations with entities which persist outside or across messages.\r\nExamples: \r\n - Problem is a consequence of a diagnosis.\r\n - Diagnosis is supported by observation.\r\n - Observation is a manifestation of a diagnosis.\r\n - Complication is a consequence of a procedure.","sample":"","chapters":["CH_12"],"fields":[{"id":"REL.1","type":"Field","position":"REL.1","name":"Set Id -rel","length":4,"usage":"C","rpt":"1","dataType":"SI","dataTypeName":"Sequence Id","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"REL.2","type":"Field","position":"REL.2","name":"Relationship Type","length":0,"usage":"R","rpt":"1","dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"REL.3","type":"Field","position":"REL.3","name":"This Relationship Instance Identifier","length":0,"usage":"R","rpt":"1","dataType":"EI","dataTypeName":"Entity Identifier","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"REL.4","type":"Field","position":"REL.4","name":"Source Information Instance Identifier","length":0,"usage":"R","rpt":"1","dataType":"EI","dataTypeName":"Entity Identifier","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"REL.5","type":"Field","position":"REL.5","name":"Target Information Instance Identifier","length":0,"usage":"R","rpt":"1","dataType":"EI","dataTypeName":"Entity Identifier","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"REL.6","type":"Field","position":"REL.6","name":"Asserting Entity Instance Id","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"EI","dataTypeName":"Entity Identifier","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"REL.7","type":"Field","position":"REL.7","name":"Asserting Person","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"XCN","dataTypeName":"Extended Composite Id Number And Name For Persons","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"REL.8","type":"Field","position":"REL.8","name":"Asserting Organization","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"XON","dataTypeName":"Extended Composite Name And Identification Number For Organizations","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"REL.9","type":"Field","position":"REL.9","name":"Assertor Address","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"XAD","dataTypeName":"Extended Address","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"REL.10","type":"Field","position":"REL.10","name":"Assertor Contact","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"XTN","dataTypeName":"Extended Telecommunication Number","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"REL.11","type":"Field","position":"REL.11","name":"Assertion Date Range","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"DR","dataTypeName":"Date/time Range","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"REL.12","type":"Field","position":"REL.12","name":"Negation Indicator","length":1,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"ID","dataTypeName":"Coded Value For Hl7 Defined Tables","tableId":"0136","tableName":"Yes/no Indicator","description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"REL.13","type":"Field","position":"REL.13","name":"Certainty Of Relationship","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"REL.14","type":"Field","position":"REL.14","name":"Priority No","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"NM","dataTypeName":"Numeric","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"REL.15","type":"Field","position":"REL.15","name":"Priority  Sequence No (rel Preference For Consideration)","length":0,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"NM","dataTypeName":"Numeric","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"REL.16","type":"Field","position":"REL.16","name":"Separability Indicator","length":1,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"ID","dataTypeName":"Coded Value For Hl7 Defined Tables","tableId":"0136","tableName":"Yes/no Indicator","description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null}],"sequence":null,"usage":null,"rpt":null,"isGroup":false,"segments":null}
