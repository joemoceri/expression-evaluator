{"id":"ADT_A31","msgStructId":"ADT_A31","eventDesc":"Update Person Information","description":"An A31 event can be used to update person information on an MPI.  It is similar to an A08 (update patient information) event, but an A08 (update patient information) event should be used to update patient information for a current episode.  An A28 (add person information) or A31 can also be used for backloading MPI information for the person, or for backloading person and historical information. \r\n\r\nTo maintain backward compatibility with previous releases, the PV1 segment is required.  However, a “pseudo-optional” PV1 can be achieved by valuing PV1-2 - Patient Class to N - not applicable.
