{"id":"QBP_Q13","msgStructId":"QBP_Q13","eventDesc":"Query by Parameter Requesting an RTB Tabular Response","description":"The QBP_Q13 structure supports a Tabular Response and contains the MSH, RDF, RCP, and DSC segments.  Its default trigger event is Q13.  A standard or site-defined query may use this trigger event or may specify a unique trigger event value in its Conformance Statement.  If a unique trigger event value is chosen for a site-defined query, that value must begin with Z.\r\n\r\nNote on QBP: Query By Example variant:  The query by example is an extension of Query By Parameter (QBP) in which search parameters are passed by sending them in the segment which naturally carries them. A Conformance Statement which uses this variant must replace the ellipses in the input QBP_Q11 grammar above, with the specific segments that it accepts.
