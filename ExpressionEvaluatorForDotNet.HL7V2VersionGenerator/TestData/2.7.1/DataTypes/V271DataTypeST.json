{"id":"ST","type":"DataType","name":"String Data","description":"The String data type is used for text data when the appearance of text does not bear meaning. This is true for formalized text, symbols and formal expressions, and all kinds of names intended for machine processing (e.g., sorting, querying, indexing, etc.).\r\n\r\nString data is left justified (i.e., no leading blank space) with trailing blanks optional. Any displayable (printable) ACSII characters (hexadecimal values between 20 and 7E, inclusive, or ASCII decimal values between 32 and 126), except the defined escape characters and defined delimiter characters.\r\n\r\nExample 1: A textual ST field:\r\n|almost any data at all|\r\n\r\nTo include any HL7 delimiter character (except the segment terminator) within a string data field, use the appropriate HL7 escape sequence (see Section 2.7.1, \"Formatting Codes”).\r\n\r\nST has no inbuilt semantics – these are assigned where the ST is used. In each case where ST is used, minimum, maximum, and conformance lengths may be specified.  Unless specified in the context of use, values of type ST may not be truncated.\r\n\r\nUsage note: The ST data type is intended for short strings (e.g., less than 1000 characters). For longer strings the TX or FT data types should be used (see Sections 2.A.79, “TX - text data” or 2.A.31, “FT - formatted text data”).\r\n\r\nAlternate character set note: ST - string data may also be used to express other character sets. See Section 2.15.9.18, \"Character set,\" and Section 2.15.9.20, \"Alternate character set handling\" for details.","dataType":null,"dataTypeName":null,"length":0,"usage":null,"rpt":null,"tableId":null,"tableName":null,"sample":"","fields":[]}
