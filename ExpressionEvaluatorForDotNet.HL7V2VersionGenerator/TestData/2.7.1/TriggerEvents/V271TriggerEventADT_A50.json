{"id":"ADT_A50","msgStructId":"ADT_A50","eventDesc":"Change visit number","description":"A change has been done at the visit identifier level. That is, a PV1-19 - Visit Number has been found to be incorrect and has been changed.\r\n\r\nAn A50 event is used to signal a change of an incorrectly assigned visit number value. The \"incorrect source visit number\" value is stored in the MRG segment (MRG-5 - Prior Visit Number) and is to be changed to the \"correct target visit number\" value stored in the PV1 segment (PV1-19 - Visit Number).\r\n\r\nEach superior identifier associated with this visit number identifier level, i.e. PID-3/MRG-1 and PID-18/MRG-3 should have the same value in both the PID and MRG segments.\r\n\r\nSee sections 3.6.2, \"Merging patient/person information,\" and 3.6.2.1.4, \"Change identifier,\" for a discussion of issues related to the implementation of change messages.\r\n\r\nThe fields included when this message is sent should be the fields pertinent to communicate this event. When demographic data in other fields change, it is recommended that the A08 (update patient information) event be used in conjunction with this message.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_03"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","segmentId":null,"longName":"Message Header","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"SFT","segmentId":null,"longName":"Software Segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"2","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"UAC","segmentId":null,"longName":"User Authentication Credential Segment","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"3","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"EVN","segmentId":null,"longName":"Event Type","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"4","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PID","segmentId":null,"longName":"Patient Identification","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"5","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PD1","segmentId":null,"longName":"Patient Additional Demographic","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"6","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"MRG","segmentId":null,"longName":"Merge Patient Information","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"7","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PV1","segmentId":null,"longName":"Patient Visit","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"8","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}
