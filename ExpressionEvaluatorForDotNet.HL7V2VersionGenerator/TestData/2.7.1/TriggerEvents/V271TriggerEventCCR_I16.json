{"id":"CCR_I16","msgStructId":"CCR_I16","eventDesc":"Collaborative Care Referral","description":"This event triggers a message to be sent from one healthcare provider to another regarding a specific patient or group of patients.  The intent is to create a collaborative relationship between the referring provider, the referred to provider or providers and the patient or patients, for the shared care of the patient or patients. Whilst the acknowledgment is a simple ACK message, the expectation is that the referred to provider(s) will send back a CCU â€“ Asynchronous Collaborative Care Update at a later time to indicate acceptance or rejection of the referral.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_11"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","segmentId":null,"longName":"Message
