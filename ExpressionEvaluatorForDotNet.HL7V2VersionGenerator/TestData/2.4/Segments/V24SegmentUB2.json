{"id":"UB2","segmentId":"UB2","longName":"UB92 Data","description":"The UB2 segment contains data necessary to complete UB92 bills. Only UB82 and UB92 fields that do not exist in other HL7 defined segments appear in this segment.  Just as with the UB82 billing, Patient Name and Date of Birth are required; they are included in the PID segment and therefore do not appear here. When the field locators are different on the UB92, as compared to the UB82, the element is listed with its new location in parentheses ( ). The UB codes listed as examples are not an exhaustive or current list; refer to a UB specification for additional information.\r\n\r\nThe Uniform Billing segments are specific to the US and may not be implemented in non-US systems.","sample":"","chapters":["CH_06"],"fields":[{"id":"UB2.1","type":"Field","position":"UB2.1","name":"Set ID - UB2","length":4,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"SI","dataTypeName":"Sequence ID","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"UB2.2","type":"Field","position":"UB2.2","name":"Co-Insurance Days (9)","length":3,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"UB2.3","type":"Field","position":"UB2.3","name":"Condition Code (24-30)","length":2,"usage":"O","rpt":"7","dataType":"IS","dataTypeName":"Coded value for user-defined tables","tableId":"0043","tableName":"Condition code","description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"UB2.4","type":"Field","position":"UB2.4","name":"Covered Days (7)","length":3,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"UB2.5","type":"Field","position":"UB2.5","name":"Non-Covered Days (8)","length":4,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"UB2.6","type":"Field","position":"UB2.6","name":"Value Amount & Code (39-41)","length":11,"usage":"O","rpt":"12","dataType":"UVC","dataTypeName":"Value Code And Amount","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"UB2.7","type":"Field","position":"UB2.7","name":"Occurrence Code & Date (32-35)","length":11,"usage":"O","rpt":"8","dataType":"OCD","dataTypeName":"Occurence","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"UB2.8","type":"Field","position":"UB2.8","name":"Occurrence Span Code/Dates (36)","length":28,"usage":"O","rpt":"2","dataType":"OSP","dataTypeName":"Occurence Span","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"UB2.9","type":"Field","position":"UB2.9","name":"UB92 Locator 2 (state)","length":29,"usage":"O","rpt":"2","dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"UB2.10","type":"Field","position":"UB2.10","name":"UB92 Locator 11 (state)","length":12,"usage":"O","rpt":"2","dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"UB2.11","type":"Field","position":"UB2.11","name":"UB92 Locator 31 (national)","length":5,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"UB2.12","type":"Field","position":"UB2.12","name":"Document Control Number","length":23,"usage":"O","rpt":"3","dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"UB2.13","type":"Field","position":"UB2.13","name":"UB92 Locator 49 (national)","length":4,"usage":"O","rpt":"23","dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"UB2.14","type":"Field","position":"UB2.14","name":"UB92 Locator 56 (state)","length":14,"usage":"O","rpt":"5","dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"UB2.15","type":"Field","position":"UB2.15","name":"UB92 Locator 57 (national)","length":27,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"UB2.16","type":"Field","position":"UB2.16","name":"UB92 Locator 78 (state)","length":2,"usage":"O","rpt":"2","dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"UB2.17","type":"Field","position":"UB2.17","name":"Special Visit Count","length":3,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"NM","dataTypeName":"Numeric","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null}],"sequence":null,"usage":null,"rpt":null,"isGroup":false,"segments":null}
