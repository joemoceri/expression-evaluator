{"id":"AIL","segmentId":"AIL","longName":"Appointment Information - Location Resource","description":"The AIL segment contains information about location resources (meeting rooms, operating rooms, examination rooms, or other locations) that can be scheduled. Resources included in a transaction using this segment are assumed to be controlled by a schedule on a schedule filler application. Resources not controlled by a schedule are not identified on a schedule request using this segment. Location resources are identified with this specific segment because of the specific encoding of locations used by the HL7 specification.","sample":"","chapters":["CH_10"],"fields":[{"id":"AIL.1","type":"Field","position":"AIL.1","name":"Set ID - AIL","length":4,"usage":"R","rpt":"1","dataType":"SI","dataTypeName":"Sequence ID","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"AIL.2","type":"Field","position":"AIL.2","name":"Segment Action Code","length":3,"usage":"C","rpt":"1","dataType":"ID","dataTypeName":"Coded values for HL7 tables","tableId":"0206","tableName":"Segment action code","description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"AIL.3","type":"Field","position":"AIL.3","name":"Location Resource ID","length":80,"usage":"C","rpt":"1","dataType":"PL","dataTypeName":"Person Location","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"AIL.4","type":"Field","position":"AIL.4","name":"Location Type-AIL","length":250,"usage":"R","rpt":"1","dataType":"CE","dataTypeName":"Coded Element","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"AIL.5","type":"Field","position":"AIL.5","name":"Location Group","length":250,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"CE","dataTypeName":"Coded Element","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"AIL.6","type":"Field","position":"AIL.6","name":"Start Date/Time","length":26,"usage":"C","rpt":"1","dataType":"TS","dataTypeName":"Time Stamp","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"AIL.7","type":"Field","position":"AIL.7","name":"Start Date/Time Offset","length":20,"usage":"C","rpt":"1","dataType":"NM","dataTypeName":"Numeric","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"AIL.8","type":"Field","position":"AIL.8","name":"Start Date/Time Offset Units","length":250,"usage":"C","rpt":"1","dataType":"CE","dataTypeName":"Coded Element","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"AIL.9","type":"Field","position":"AIL.9","name":"Duration","length":20,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"NM","dataTypeName":"Numeric","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"AIL.10","type":"Field","position":"AIL.10","name":"Duration Units","length":250,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","dataType":"CE","dataTypeName":"Coded Element","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"AIL.11","type":"Field","position":"AIL.11","name":"Allow Substitution Code","length":10,"usage":"C","rpt":"1","dataType":"IS","dataTypeName":"Coded value for user-defined tables","tableId":"0279","tableName":"Allow substitution codes","description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null},{"id":"AIL.12","type":"Field","position":"AIL.12","name":"Filler Status Code","length":250,"usage":"C","rpt":"1","dataType":"CE","dataTypeName":"Coded Element","tableId":"0278","tableName":"Filler status codes","description":null,"sample":null,"fields":null}],"sequence":null,"usage":null,"rpt":null,"isGroup":false,"segments":null}
