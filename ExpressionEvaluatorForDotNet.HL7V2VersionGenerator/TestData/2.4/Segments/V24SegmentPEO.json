{"id":"PEO","segmentId":"PEO","longName":"Product Experience Observation","description":"Details related to a particular clinical experience or event are embodied in the PEO segment. This segment can be used to characterize an event which might be attributed to a product to which the patient was exposed. Products with a possible causal relationship to the observed experience are described in the following PCR (possible causal relationship) segments. The message format was designed to be robust and includes many optional elements which may not be required for a particular regulatory purpose but allow a complete representation of the drug experience if needed.","sample":"","chapters":["CH_07"],"fields":[{"id":"PEO.1","type":"Field","position":"PEO.1","name":"Event Identifiers
