{"id":"ADT_A08","msgStructId":"ADT_A08","eventDesc":"Update patient information","description":"This trigger event is used when any patient information has changed but when no other trigger event has occurred.  For example, an A08 event can be used to notify the receiving systems of a change of address or a name change.  We recommend that the A08 transaction be used to update fields that are not related to any of the other trigger events.  The A08 event can include information specific to an episode of care, but it can also be used for demographic information only.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_03"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","segmentId":null,"longName":"Message Header","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"EVN","segmentId":null,"longName":"Event Type","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"2","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PID","segmentId":null,"longName":"Patient identification","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"3","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PD1","segmentId":null,"longName":"Patient Additional Demographic","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"4","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"ROL","segmentId":null,"longName":"Role","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"5","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NK1","segmentId":null,"longName":"Next of kin / associated parties","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"6","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PV1","segmentId":null,"longName":"Patient visit","description":null,"sample":null,"chapters":null,"fields":null,"sequence":"7","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PV2","segmentId":null,"longName":"Patient visit -
