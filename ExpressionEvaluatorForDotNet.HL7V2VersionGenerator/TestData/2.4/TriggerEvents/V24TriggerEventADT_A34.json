It was used to change patient identifiers on all of this patientâ€™s existing accounts.\r\n\r\nEvent A34 has been retained for backward compatibility only.  From V2.3.1 onwards, event A40 (Merge patient - patient identifier list) should be used instead. Only the patient identifier list has changed as a result of the merge.
